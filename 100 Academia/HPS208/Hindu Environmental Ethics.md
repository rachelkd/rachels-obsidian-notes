# Hindu Environmental Ethics

From [[Animal Sentience (ASENT)]]:

- Hard to say anything definite about animal sentience without something like a *theory* of sentience in general
    - What does it mean to be sentient?
    - How is sentience realized in a living thing?
- Somewhat unsatisfied with the criteria provided by ASENT
    - As were the authors
    - Relied on behavioural and neurological tests, but
- What we really want to know:
    - ? What is it like from the POV of an organism itself?

We look at this question of sentience and ethics from a broadly Hindu perspective.

- They have an account of what makes something sentient

> [!tldr]+ Framarin (2012)
>
> - Defends a basic tenet of this debate
>     - & We owe something to non-humans

- Want to explore what the basic Hindu metaphysics of sentience mean for **environmental ethics**

## Environmental Ethics

> [!def]+ Environmental Ethics
>
> - Sub-discipline that asks what our ==ethical obligations== are towards the natural environment
> - Two forms of obligations:
>     - **Prudential**
>     - **Intrinsic**

- Environmental ethics can include:
    - Humans, animals, plants
    - Sometimes rivers and mountains

### Prudential Obligations

Example of a **prudential** reason:

> [!example]+ Bad idea for humans to burn every forest and boil oceans
>
> - All humans would likely die
> - Presumably, we care about humans

- Looks at the environment ==as a means to some end==
    - i.e., Keeping us alive
- This is **anthropocentric** reasoning
    - Puts humans at the centre of things
    - “anthro-”:
        - Human
    - “-pocentric”:
        - Put in the middle

### Intrinsic Obligations

- In addition to caring about keeping ourselves alive,
    - Environmental ethics often involves concerns about non-human living things for their ==own sake==
- This type of ethical consideration is **intrinsic**

> [!question] How much consideration do we owe to the interests of non-human organisms?

### The Scope of Environmental Ethics

- In [[Animal Sentience (ASENT)|ASENT]]:
    - Talked about intrinsic value of animals
- Environmental ethics also considers the intrinsic interests of *plants*
- More controversially:
    - Some have argued that we should also consider the intrinsic interests of:
        - Whole ecosystems, or
        - Geological formations e.g., mountains and rivers

#### The Personhood of Rivers

- Various people around the world have assigned personhood to parts of the natural world like mountains
- Morris and Ruru argue that:
    - Rivers should be legally recognized as persons in New Zealand law, since
    - Maori regard them as ancestors
- → Would ==allow human representatives== to argue on their behalf in court
    - In the same way that representatives argue on behalf of a human who cannot do so on their own behalf
- One way authors propose to allow Maori people to get their treaty laws recognized:
    - Allow things like rivers to have legal personhood such that people can argued on their behalf in court
    - Would not have to argue that there is people harm (in polluting, exploiting, or diverting a river)
    - Can instead argue that the river is harmed by this
    - Bar for direct harm is lowered

<!-- break -->
- This isn’t an entirely new thing:
    - Corporations are considered as persons in US law
    - Not obvious why a corporation can have personhood, but not something like rivers
- Person has a definition of the law; being a person entitles you to certain protections
    - [[Animal Sentience (ASENT)|ASENT]]: Animals are mostly considered property
    - Being property does not automatically give you protections
    - To make it illegal to kill an animal that nobody owns: Have to show that somebody was hurt
        - Somebody does not include animal itself (in Canadian law at least)
        - Raises the bar about what counts as harm towards that being

## Main Reading

> [!tldr]+ Framarin (2012)
>
> - Goal:
>     - Defend the idea that a ==plausible environmental ethic== should ==attribute intrinsic value== to non-human parts of nature
> - In his full book:
>     - Questions: Do the basic tenets of Hinduism offer a plausible environmental ethic?
>     - He argues yes, but why is his concern

### The Last Man

> [!quote]+ Routley (1973, p. 207)
> “The last man (or person) surviving the collapse of the world system lays about him, eliminating, as far as he can, every living thing, animal or plant (but painlessly if you like, as at the best abattoirs). What he does is quite permissible according to basic chauvinism \[that is, anthropocentrism], but on environmental grounds what he does is wrong. Moreover one does not have to be committed to esoteric values to regard Mr. Last Man as behaving badly.”

> [!summary]+ The Last Man Thought Experiment
>
> - Knows they are the last and there will be no more humans after
> - Only thing that makes them happy is killing everything they can see
> - ? Is that an okay thing to do? Is this *morally wrong*?
>     - Most would say that is not okay

- Framarin:
    - Notes that this argument seems to intuitively work for both plants and animals
        - If last surviving person burned down an old growth forest for fun, that still seems wrong
            - Even if no animals are hurt
    - Asks us to imagine it is the last person’s final hours alive
        - → Eliminate concern about bad habits developing, etc.
- & It is the destruction itself that seems bad
    - **Immanuel Kant**:
        - Said: Morally wrong for humans to hurt animals without good reasons because you develop habits that are bad
        - e.g., If you kick animals for fun, eventually you are going to kick a toddler
            - $\because$ Training yourself to ignore the sounds of pain
    - Reason why you probably have this intuition is because you believe that there is some *intrinsic value* to non-human things
- & → A plausible environmental ethic should take into account the intrinsic interests of non-human living things
    - This is Framarin’s first argument

> [!abstract]+ Hindu Environmental Ethics
>
> - Framarin goes into more detail on why specifically ==Hinduism provides a plausible environmental ethic==
>     - ? Do the basic tenets of Hinduism give us some plausible environmental ethic?
> - Considers a number of proposals in the literature on this

## Hinduisms

- Not really appropriate to think of it as a single religion
- Hinduism contains a bunch of different threads
    - Culturally, socially, philosophically
- One common thing that unites the threads:
    - The **Vedas**
        - As a cultural root
- Framarin draws on some of the important texts from Vedas
    - Pick big ideas
    - → Use those to form his own argument

### The Vedas

> [!def]+ The Vedas
>
> - Massive collection of texts
>     - Form the oldest layer of Hindu literature
> - Regarded as ==author-less==
>     - Having transmitted from superhuman sources long ago

- Orally transmitted for thousand of years
    - Used extremely rigorous set of mnemonic practices to ensure accurate transmission
- Vedas include a wide variety of material
    - From descriptions to rituals
    - Stories about gods to philosophical discourses
- Six main *orthodox* schools of Indian philosophy
    - Each with own interpretation of central messages of Vedas

> [!note] Framarin draws on some of the most central and agreed upon points to build his analysis

### A Theory of Sentience

We get a clear theory of sentience from the Vedas.

- The Vedas:
    - Sentience is a result of all living things having **Atman**
- **Atman**
    - Can loosely translate as *soul* or *self*
        - ! Not the personality of an individual or egoic sense of themselves
    - Think of Atman like the thing that makes possible and underlies feelings, volitions, having a life
        - Atman makes something aware of all that particularity of one’s life
    - The basic “**witness consciousness**” that makes personality or egoic sense possible
    - Understood as related to *Brahman*
        - Ultimate principle of reality
            - (Though the various orthodox schools disagree about exactly how)
- & In Hinduism: Atman makes you sentient and conscious
    - Unstained by sins, un-elevated by victories and virtues, unaffected by anything, but
    - It is what makes you conscious
- Atman is in humans, animals, plants
    - Across the living world

### Reincarnation

- Atman:
    - Timeless and eternal
    - Unaffected by changing material conditions
- **Reincarnation**
    - Some aspects of oneself are re-born/re-incarnated after one’s death in the cycle of *samsara*
    - Next birth may be fortunate or unfortunate
        - Based on the (un)virtuous actions one performs in life
        - i.e., If you live well → Fortunate birth next time
            - If you live badly → Unfortunate birth
            - Being born as human is widely regarded as one of the good births
    - Reincarnation into animals or plants is possible

### Moksha

- **Moksha**
    - & Liberation from the cycle of samsara
        - Vedas: Generally describe cycle of rebirth as unpleasant
    - Usually understood to be achieved by realizing sufficiently ==deep self-knowledge==
        - Fundamentally what you really are at the core underneath your history, personality, etc.
        - Once you have this realization, you do not need to continue to be re-born
- Final stages of Moksha:
    - Renunciation; removing yourself from life
- Pre-requisite to moksha and self-knowledge:
    - & Must live a virtuous life without causing harm to other sentient beings

### Ahimsa

- **Ahimsa**
    - One of the things you need to get to moksha
    - Roughly translates to ==non-harm== or ==non-violence==
- **Himsa**
    - i.e., Violence
    - Understood to produce negative *karmic* consequences for the person committing it
    - Hinders progress towards moksha
- Various schools differ in exactly what counts as ahimsa
    - e.g., What to say about self-defense
- Basic idea:
    - & Not harming sentient beings

### Vegetarianism

Ahimsa entails vegetarianism.

- ? Who is it okay to eat?
    - (Returning to original course question/motivation)
    - Hindu philosophy generally says: ==Not okay to eat animals==
- & Killing and eating animals is considered *himsa* (generally)

> [!quote]+ Framarin (p.27)
> “Manusmrti 5.53, for example, reads:  The person who performs the horse sacrifice every single year for 100 years and the one who will not eat  meat are equal, the result (phala) of  the merit (punya) of these two is equal.”

- Horse sacrifice:
    - Long, very expensive, elaborate ritual
    - Nobody can do this for 100 years
    - Complicated and involved
    - At the end, you sacrifice a horse
- You can do the horse sacrifice for 100 years, or just become a vegetarian
    - Result of both are equivalent
- Parts of Vedas involve Gods killing animals for various reasons
    - Vegetarianism is not an absolutism, but
- Overwhelming view:
    - Do as little of this as you can
    - If you are looking for enlightenment/liberation from samsara:
        - Eating meat is not a good move

## Instrumentalist Arguments

> [!attention]+ Framarin (2014) *critiques* a few arguments that try to show that ==animal life is only of instrumental value== in Hinduism
>
> - Ahimsa towards animals is recommended only because it is an obstacle to moksha
>     - i.e., You should not kill animals under Hinduism because it slows you down on the path to liberation
>     - A *prudential* account of one’s relationship with environment under Hinduism
> - Framarin believes:
>     - This argument ==does not constitute a plausible environmental ethic==
>     - i.e., If this is true, then Hinduism does not provide what Framarin is looking for

### Argument from Illusion

From Framarin (2014, p.24),

> [!tldr]+ Premise 1
>
> - Certain Hindu texts and traditions claim that everything other  than the ātman is a product of māyā (a deluding force), and hence  illusory.

- One of the things the six orthodox schools disagree about:
    - Whether the world we inhabit is real or an illusion

> [!tldr]+ Premise 2
>
> - Anything that is illusory is devoid of intrinsic value.

- If the world is an illusion:
    - Everything other than ātman — including animals and plants — is devoid of intrinsic value
    - → Devoid of direct moral standing

> [!tldr]+ Conclusion 1/Premise 3
>
> - Hence certain Hindu texts and traditions entail that ==everything== other than the ātman — including animals and plants — is ==devoid of *intrinsic* value==.

> [!tldr]+ Premise 4
>
> - If certain Hindu texts and traditions entail that everything other than the ātman is devoid of intrinsic value, then they entail that everything other than the ātman — including animals and plants — is ==devoid of **direct moral standing**==.

> [!tldr]+ Conclusion 2
>
> - Hence, certain Hindu texts and traditions entail that everything other than the ātman — including animals and plants — is devoid of direct moral standing

- If everything you have ever encountered is an illusion:
    - You do not have to care about illusions
- & Instrumentalist argument to show that ahimsa (non-violence) is for the purpose of liberation
    - Not because you are supposed to care about these animals
    - These animals and everything other than the ātman is an illusion

#### Response to the Argument from Illusion

Framarin responds:

- & If nothing except atman is intrinsically valuable, then it becomes absolutely ==arbitrary whether himsa or ahimsa are virtuous==
- Instrumentalists say: Shouldn’t do harm so you can get liberated $\because$ virtuous actions lead to liberation
    - ? Then, why is (non)harm (un)virtuous?
- If animals and plants lack direct moral standing:
    - ? Why is ahimsa a good thing to practice in the first place?

> [!important]+ It is only if ahimsa is a good thing in and of itself that it makes sense to consider it a way of accumulating merit, and therefore a stepping stone to moksha
>
> - There has to be something that implies intrinsic value
>     - Matters not just for the sake of personal liberation
>     - Matters because other living things matter
> - Instrumentalist argument then makes its arbitrary whether violence is bad or non-violence is good

## Arguments for Intrinsic Value in Non-human Living Things

- Instrumentalist argument was a *prudential* account for (non)violence

> [!question] Why do animals and plants have direct moral standing?

- Two types of interpretations that attempt to attribute intrinsic value to non-humans:
    - **Interconnectedness**
    - **Sameness**

### Interconnectedness Interpretations

- Hindu metaphysics say that ==all of nature is interconnected==, and this underwrites the moral status of animals and plants
    - i.e., All beings are one; harming one of them is harming every one of them
    - Therefore, we should care about the interests of other beings
    - ! Framarin does not think this is the correct interpretation however

#### Deutsch (1970)

> [!quote]+ Quoted in Framarin 2014, p. 42
> “\[t]he first and perhaps most obvious core idea needed by us to establish and sustain a proper relation with physical nature is the idea that ==every-thing in nature is interconnected with everything else==. This idea means that nature is so constituted that ==any action performed will have its effect over a wide, complex and oftentimes unforeseen terrain== … According to the doctrine of \[karma] …\[w]hatever one does will have effects not only in the immediate present but in the long future as well: any act, in short, will have consequences that reach out far beyond the act itself.”
>
> (Deutsch 1970: 80–81)

- Deutsch:
    - Karma is supposed to give us interconnection
    - Interconnection is supposed to make us care about other things
- Framarin *objects*:
    - Not what the doctrine of karma says
    - **Karma**
        - Idea that your past and present actions will have consequences for your current and future incarnations
    - Karma is not to connect all living things into a web;
        - & Just connects you to ==yourself== (at a future time; future incarnations of yourself)
    - The idea of re-birth means that you probably should not eat animals since you may one day be an animal yourself
        - A *prudential* reason for ahimsa, not intrinsic

Interconnectedness interpretation then does not do a good job of attributing intrinsic value to non-humans.

### Sameness Interpretations

From Framarin (2014, p. 63):

> [!tldr]+ Premise 1
>
> - Certain Hindu texts and traditions claim that ==individual, living, non-human entities in nature, such as animals and plants, are the same, in some sense, as brahman==.

- **Brahman**
    - Universal principle behind all reality
    - Sacred part of reality itself

> [!tldr]+ Premise 2
>
> - Brahman has direct moral standing.

> [!tldr]+ Premise 3
>
> - If individual, living, non-human entities in nature are the same, in some sense, as brahman, and if brahman has direct moral standing, then ==individual entities in nature have direct moral standing==.

> [!tldr]+ Conclusion
>
> - & So certain Hindu texts and traditions claim that individual, living, non-human entities in nature, such as animals and plants, have direct moral standing.

- Basic idea:
    - We inherit our intrinsic value from our connection to this universal principle, brahman
    - Every one of us has atman
        - Atman is connected to brahman
    - Therefore, we each have this moral standing based on brahman

#### Framarin’s Response

Framarin *objects*:

- & Brahman does not have “moral standing” in anything like the way individual living things do
    - Nothing we could possibly do can hurt or help brahman
- Not even the individual atman is affected by material concerns

> [!quote]+ Bhagavadgita, quoted in Framarin (2014, p. 68)
> “Weapons do not cut \[the ātman], fire does not burn it, waters do not wet it, the wind does not desiccate it … The body being killed, \[the ātman] is not killed.”

- Something being sacred and people having a moral responsibility to it might be different
    - Moral responsibility implies that one can help or hurt you, but
    - Cannot do anything for or against brahman
- We have been framing intrinsic moral duties as:
    - Considering the interests, desires, perspectives, harm and benefit to the other being
- None of that applies to brahman
    - Can act poorly, but that is an individual problem
    - Not a brahman problem
    - Divine is not concerned at all about whether one obtains moksha or re-births as the worst thing ever

## Framarin’s Answer

- If Framarin rejects these accounts of why animals and plants have intrinsic moral standing in Hinduism, then:
    - ? What is his answer?
- Hinduism provides a plausible environmental ethic because:
    - It attributes sentience across the living world, and
    - It is bad to hurt sentient beings

<!-- break -->
- If that is correct, then it is the same basic reason a non-Hindu could give
    - Other than the theory of sentience, reason does not depend on any complexities about reincarnation, karma, liberation
    - Hinduism: There is ==something it is like to be an animal or plant==
        - That means you should not hurt them
        - Basic, ground-level moral that you should take other beings into account

## Why is it Okay to Eat Plants?

- No definitive answer
- Potential answers:
    - It is not okay;
        - Taking any life is bad, but taking plant life is not as bad, or
    - Plant based food that does not kill the plant (e.g., fallen fruit) should be preferred, or
    - There is a divine sanction for humans to eat plants because we need them to live

### Ahimsa in Jainism

- **Jainism**
    - A heterodox school of Indian philosophy
    - Has a specific answer to this question
- Ranks living things by the number of senses they have
    - Ranked complexity of experience of the world
    - Do the least amount of harm by killing those with the least complex experience of the world
    - e.g., Plants have only the sense of touch and basic vital functions like growth, but
        - Humans have five senses
        - So, the amount of harm done by harvesting a plant is significantly less than by killing an animal for food
    - The more senses you have, the more pain and suffering you undergo when somebody kills and eats you

<!-- break -->
- A Jain monastic:
    - May wear a mask over their mouth to avoid accidentally swallowing a bug
    - Regard even microorganisms as worth of protection
    - Regard the basic problem with violence as its being a ==manifestation of passion==, which
        - Is a hindrance to moksha
    - The reason why harm is bad is because it is born out of passion
        - “I want to eat that cheeseburger” is a kind of passion
        - This passion gets your stuck in samsara
- So, you should do non-harm for your own benefit
