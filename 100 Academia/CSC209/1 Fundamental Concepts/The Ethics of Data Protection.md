# The Ethics of Data Protection

When you shift from your own computer to a shared computer system, the biggest differences are:

- Shared computational resources
    - Raises questions about fairness
- Shared file storage
    - Raises questions about *privacy*

## Privacy Harms

> [!summary]+ Citron and Solove (2021)‘s typology of privacy harms
> - Physical harms
> - Economic harms
> - Reputational harms
> - Discrimination harms
> - Relationship harms
> - Psychological harms

## Harmless Wrongs

Imagine that someone goes into a folder on the shared system that you accidentally left public and views some of your information. Suppose they do nothing at all with that information, and you never find out? Is it wrong of them to do so?

> [!obs]+ Harmless Wrong
> - In these cases, someone is wronged, but
>     - They do not seem to be ==noticeably harmed==
> - This is a **harmless wrong**

> [!attention]+ Argument. Harmless wrongs are impossible.
> 1. You can only harm someone if they are aware of the harm
> 2. You can only wrong someone if you cause them harm
>
> Therefore, you ==can only wrong someone if you cause them a harm that they are aware of==.

> [!example]+ Counterexample. Friendship.
> - Suppose that you have many friends, lots of good conversations with them, and they affirm and support you, but
> - Actually, your friends do not like you and they make fun of you behind your back, and
> - You never find out
>
> > [!important] Parfit. Your life has gone worse than if your friends really did like you.

- Your life can be made worse by things that you are not aware of
- → You can be harmed by things that you are not aware of
- Argument/premise is incorrect
