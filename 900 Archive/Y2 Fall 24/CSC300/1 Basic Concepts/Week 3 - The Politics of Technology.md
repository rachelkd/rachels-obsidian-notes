# Human and Technology

> [!question]- Questions
>
> - What are the roles of humans for making a technology ethical?
> - How to analyze the ethics of a technology?

## Why Does it Matter if Technology Has Politics

- Technology is not designed or used in isolation
    - Future designers need to understand the context and politics in which technology operates
    - Not only important to understand how and if technology affects the contexts for which you are designing
- Even if technology is helping everyone, it does not mean it is ethical

    - May not be helping everyone equally (i.e., ==equity==)
    - Some people are benefitting, some people are being marginalized → ==technology is political==
    - Technology often benefits the privileged more than marginalized groups
        - e.g., ChatGPT and education

- Is the relationship between technology and society unidirectional, or bi-directional
    - When societies change, then so does technology
    - ==Bi-directional==
    - e.g., the invention of airplanes → society changed completely
        - City needed airports, new businesses emerged, oil industry saw an opportunity, new jobs
    - e.g., Second World War (society) → new technology emerged
- Can technologies be neutral?
    - No
    - Not every part of society gets equal benefit out of technology

# Four Theoretical Perspectives

1. Realism
2. Social constructivism
3. Hybrid constructivism
4. Differentiated constructivism

# Realism

- Theory given by ==Landon Winner==
- Argument:
    - Everything we see in society is created by a technological innovation that shapes society
        - e.g., Innovation of houses created the concept of family, or
        - Facebook and YouTube enable users to exercise freedom of speech by creating and sharing user-generated content, accessible to others for free, or
        - Providing laptops or PCs to students in low-income economies improves their understanding and school performance

> [!important]- Core belief of **realism**
>
> - ==Only technology is responsible for social change==
> - Technology = building blocks of society
> - Instigators of social change or liberators
>     - causally correlated i.e., technology is the cause, and the effect is seen in society
> - Has its own agency, irreducible to agency of human agents
>     - Major independent variable

- Technologies have inherent powers
    - → Makes them democratic or authoritarian in any context of use
    - e.g., Inherently political atomic bomb
        - Needs authoritarian structure in place for decision making
        - Required a hierarchy to operate the bomb
    - e.g., Social media platforms
        - Democratize the discourse

## Critiques of Realism

- Linear causal pathway
    - There are thousand other ways that changes society, e.g., natural disaster
    - Naive way of looking at the relationship between tech and society
- Technologically deterministic
    - Thinking like technology is controlling everything, humans are puppets, which is not a complete picture
- Lacks social representation
    - Society itself is a very powerful component
    - Theory does not consider that
- Inability to explain results across a variety of contexts
    - e.g., Why did the airplane make so many societal changes in the West, but not the Global South

Real-world examples of these critiques:

- Amplification of bias:
    - Trolls and stigmatization during \#MeToo and racial attacks during COVID-19
    - Social media was not designed for this: Why did this happen?
    - If tech is so powerful that it makes society do whatever it wants to do, then why is society acting in a way that tech did not warrant
- Policy failure:
    - One laptop per child policy in low-income economies failed due to social power dynamics, infrastructure issues, and repair challenges
    - MIT Media Labs: Gave computers to children in places with broken educational systems
    - Millions of dollars wasted
    - If tech was so powerful that it can change society, why did it not work this time?

> [!important]+ Realism only gives us a partial picture of what is happening
>
> - Technology is definitely a huge force; can introduce a lot of changes in society
> - That is not the only thing that controls/affects society, though
> - Cannot just say that a new technology is going to fix everything
>     - Very myopic perspective

# Social Constructivism

- Realism says: Everything that is happening in society is controlled by technology
- Social constructivism is the opposite:
    - Technology has no role here
    - No control
    - How technology is shaped is controlled by the society (social determinism)
    - Tech does not have that ==independent power==

## Consider: Role of Algorithms and Advertising on Social Media Platforms

- Why do we see what we see on our social media timelines?
- Who is making money out of the content/ads posted on these platforms?
- Who controls these algorithms that decide what is visible on users’ profiles or timelines?
- Humans!
- Examples:
    - Netflix:
        - They did not *make* movies; hosted other people’s movies and made a business out of it
    - Amazon:
        - Makes money from out of facilitating buying and selling for other businesses
    - Facebook, Twitter, social media:
        - Do not post content that users are fans of; humans make the content

## Core Belief

> [!important]- Core belief of **social constructivism**
>
> - ==Politics of technology is *constructed* by its *social representations*==
> - **Interpretive flexibility**:
>     - Social representations dominates the ways technologies are constructed, interpreted, and used
>     - Societal power dynamics make the interpretation popular in the users’ imagination
>         - Give a light bulb to someone who has no electricity, and they will have a different interpretation of the technology
>     - Similar to a religious text: the most popular interpretation finds its use
>         - Different people may believe in different meanings of those verses
> - Social representations ==define artifacts’ political agency or *affordances*== (Pfaffenberger, 1992)
>     - Artifacts’ perceived properties suggest use, but ==lack inherent politics==
>     - Society and behaviour transform and animate these narratives
>
> <!-- break -->
>
> - Society runs the technology
> - Technology is playing the role of a ==mediator==
>     - Exists to fulfill societal needs that it did not create
> - Responding to the social needs that were already there in society
> - Way society works is reflected on the technology

- Argument 1:
    - Artifacts in themselves may have some strong and weak physical properties, such as constraints or *affordances*
    - Strong:
        - Promote/prevent actions
        - e.g., Facebook newsfeed algorithms
    - Weak:
        - Merely promote or discourage
        - e.g., Seatbelt beeps vs. interlocks
            - Can still drive with seatbelt off
        - or content reporting vs. immediate takedown
- Argument 2:
    - Reference to physical properties of artifacts because their “readings” have become obdurate through “closure”
    - Learn to read the artifact differently, so that the constraint disappears
        - e.g., algorithms are written by humans
        - It is not Facebook itself controlling what one sees; it is the people behind Facebook
        - Human controlling another human; interactions between two groups
    - Methods of verification of physical constraints are subjective to their social construction

## Critiques of Social Constructivism

- Linear causal pathway
    - Opposite way of realism, though
    - In this perspective: Society shapes technology
- Socially deterministic
- Can’t credit artifacts with having certain physical properties
    - Cannot acknowledge that technology itself can do something
- Cannot be expected to give a holistic account
    - Gives a partial view of what is happening

# Hybrid Constructivism

Hybrid constructivism sits between realism and social constructivism.

## Consider: Role of Algorithms and Advertising on News Headline Platforms

- Unintended use case:
    - News headline platforms like CTV News can influence national elections
    - Many people use CP24 for news and information
    - Raises the issue of government surveillance to prevent misinformation
- We see that technology has some impact on society, but society also has an impact on technology
    - Need to give credit to both!

## Core Belief

> [!important]- Core belief of **hybrid constructivism**
>
> - For any given situation, entities interacting within a network are analyzed using the **principles of generalized symmetry** as in *Actor-network* theory (Latour, 1987; Callon, 1987)
> - Technical, natural, and social elements interact as human or non-human actants
> - Both human and non-human actors can enact change equally
> - e.g., Uber:
>     - Is a system with a lot of human and non-human actors
>     - Driver, passenger, Uber app, driver’s app, car, Uber company, CEO, technology on server side, Internet network used to connect to app, mobile phone used for app, etc.
> - Hybrid constructivism tears apart the whole system/network to find the human and non-human actors
>     - Who is connected to who?
>     - Equal importance to all actors $\implies$ **generalized symmetry**
> - All actors are ==equally important for for understanding the politics of this system or technology==
>     - e.g., Uber experience might be bad because driver, or weather is not good, or city security/infrastructure is not good, etc.

- Politics emerges from interactions among human and non-human actors
    - (H-NH-NH-H)
- ==Power arises from interactions==, not inherent to single actants
    - Different from both realism and social constructivism
    - Not saying tech or society has all the power and shape society respectively
    - It is the *interaction*
- Stabilized networks form blackboxes
    - Obscures complex interactions

## Examples of Hybrid Constructivism

- A car is a network of components that are visible when it breaks down
    - Which piece is coming from whom, where?
    - What kind of politics are involved?
        - e.g., oil, semiconductor politics
    - See how different actors are involved with this car
- Climate change
    - Depends on the interaction of different species on the planet and knowledge produced by scientific and social science disciplines about its measurement and impact

## Strengths of Hybrid Constructivism

> “If something is missing, it is because the description is not complete” (Latour — Society is Technology made durable)

- Phenomena stabilize H-NH actor networks post-hoc
    - i.e., We can only understand a system after the system is built and operates
- Generalizes artifacts’ affordances and constraints
- Defines network properties by efficiency, truth, profitability, and interest
    - which are the domination results
- Actants’ perspectives converge to stabilize reality
    - Low convergence indicates flux (i.e., something is missing)
- Views technology and society as integral phases of essential actions
    - Not separate

## Critiques

- Humans have a more diverse behavioural repertoire than non-humans
- Taking everything equally → obscures the analytical differences in the interest of symmetrical treatment
    - Humans may have different kinds of needs when interacting with same piece of tech
    - How do you explain that humans have equal impact on the system as non-humans?
- e.g., Viewing the big picture of the role that social media platforms play in influencing national elections
    - Due to principles of generalized symmetry: difficult to determine who is responsible and to what extent
    - Different elements and their properties that enabled this
        - Treating all humans as the same actor is wrong
        - Relationship with platform varies between people
    - Big difference in impact between you posting something on social media vs. political leader

# Differentiated Constructivism

- Gives differentiated weight to different actors
    - Instead of giving all human and non-human actors equal importance in [[#Hybrid constructivism]]
    - e.g., Government and general public both play a role in social media platforms, but have different weights

## Artifacts and Agency

- Agency from material design structures and social processes
- Affordances and constraints:
    - Realist (physical tech shapes society)
    - Social constructivist (social interactions shape technology)
    - Hybrid
- Rejects exclusive determinations
- Supports hybrid and differentiated constructivist views
- Hybrid vocabulary allows broader generalizations

## Consider: Role of Algorithms and Advertising on Social Media Platforms

- Unintended use case:
    - Ability of social media platforms (e.g., Facebook) to influence national elections
    - A lot of people use Facebook to read news articles or access other information
    - ![|500](https://i.imgur.com/OiVXSrr.png)

> [!important] **Asymmetry principles** attribute differential agency to various entities

- Technology platform:
    - Determines user access, exposure, and algorithmic attributes
- Technology founders/managers:
    - Make decisions
    - Influenced by advertising revenue
    - e.g., Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg probably have different relationships with their own respective platforms (X, Meta)
- National/international lobbies:
    - Influence promotion of candidates
    - May spread misinformation
- Users:
    - Exposed to content in echo chambers → polarized opinions and voting decisions

# Summary of the Theoretical Frameworks

- Neither **realism** nor **social constructivism** offers a complete picture regarding the politics of technologies
    - Linear
    - Denial of agentic properties to the other aspect
- **Hybrid** and **differentiated constructivism**
    - Attempt to take into account all the entities involved in the interaction
    - Hybrid constructivism ==symmetrically== analyzes all elements as actants
    - Differentiated constructivism ==deconstructs== the elements; doesn’t strip them of their properties
        - Retains part realism and part social constructivism
        - Provides “depth” to the generalized analysis of hybrid constructivism
- Impact of technology on a society depends on so many things
- Technology does not have same impact on everyone in society
    - Need to analyze who is getting benefits and who is being marginalized
    - Involves many actors
