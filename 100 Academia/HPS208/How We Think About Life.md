# How We Think About Life

> [!summary]+ How We Think About Life
> - An introductory course on the history and philosophy of the life sciences

- A starting question: Who is it okay to eat, and why?
    - Every culture throughout history and across the world has had some answer to this question
    - Views of what living things are okay to eat vary widely
        - As do the reasons people have given

> [!question] What are our ethical obligations towards living things, and why?
> - Question will motivate us through at least the first half the course

- Think about the difference between living and non-living things, as well as
    - How we categorize different types of life
- → Will entangle us in some deep questions about the nature of the universe itself

## Week 2 - ASCENT

> [!question] Which species are sentient?

- We started off by asking: Who should we care about?
    - → What criteria should we be using to determine which species need protection from suffering?
- e.g., There are practical reasons why we should care about algae
    - Nobody is proposing that we need to care about algae’s feelings
    - Whereas, most countries in the world have robust protections for primates in lab experiments
    - Primates are considered **sentient**
        - i.e., Have feelings, experience the world, have some experience in the brain (vs. how that is different from consciousness)
