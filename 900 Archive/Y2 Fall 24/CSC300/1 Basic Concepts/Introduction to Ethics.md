> [!question]+ Questions
> - How do you know if an action is moral or not?
> - What is morality, and does it exist?
> - Where does moral knowledge come from?

- What is **ethics**?
    - Branch of philosophy
    - Involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behaviour

# Three Significant Areas of Study within Ethics

> [!info]- Metaethics
> - Foundations and nature of moral values, properties, and words

> [!info]- Normative ethics
> - Systems of morality and questions how one ought to be and act morally

> [!info]- Applied Ethics
> - What a person is obligated (or permitted) to do in specific situations
> - Analyzing controversial present-day moral questions
>     - e.g., abortion, euthanasia, animal rights, etc.

# Metaethics

According to philosophers Richard Garner and Bernard Rosen, there are three kinds of meta-ethical problems:
1. **Moral semantics**:
    - What is the meaning of moral terms and judgements?
2. **Moral ontology**:
    - What is the nature of moral judgements?
3. **Moral epistemology**:
    - How might moral judgements be supported or defended?

## Moral Semantics and Ontology

> [!question] What is the *meaning* of moral terms and judgements? What is the *nature* of moral judgements?

> [!important]- Two main viewpoints
> 1. Cognitivism
> 2. Non-cognitivism

### Cognitivism

- What is **cognitivism**?
    - Ethical statements are ==propositions, statements, or assertions==
    - Can either be true or false

#### Cognitive Theories

> [!info]- Three main sections of cognitive moral statements:
> 1. Realism
> 2. Subjectivism
> 3. Error Theory

##### Realism

See [[Realism]].

#### Subjectivism

See [[Subjectivism]].

#### Error Theory

- Although ethical claims do express propositions, all such propositions are ==false==
- No such thing as moral truth → all moral statements are wrong $\implies$ error

### Non-cognitivist Theories

> [!def]- Non-cognitivism
> - Ethical statements are ==not propositions== → no truth status
> - Another type of moral anti-realism
> - States that we ==cannot know anything about morality==
> - $\implies$ No point in trying to determine right or wrong statements

#### Emotivism

- Ethical sentences merely express emotions
    - e.g., “Lying is wrong” appears to be about a factual description of something
- ==A.J. Ayer==, key figure in the logical positivist movement, claims that when someone makes such a statement, they are really just *expressing an emotion*, not a claim
    - e.g., “I’m lying; that makes me upset”

#### Prescriptivism

- Moral statements function like universalized imperative sentences
    - i.e., Moral statements are just giving a command
- ==R.M. Hare==

Which view is correct? That depends on **moral epistemology**.

# Moral Epistemology

> [!def]- Moral epistemology
> - Deals with how moral knowledge is possible and derived

- To make a moral claim about reality, one must have *evidence* to support the premises
    - e.g., to claim that morality is objective and derived from a God, one would have to demonstrate how to get moral knowledge from a God, if one exists in the first place

> [!def]- Rational knowledge
> - Morality can be known by reason
> - Including “a prori” facts
>     - Plato and Immanuel Kant

> [!def]- Empirical knowledge
> - Moral knowledge may include evidence by observation
>     - e.g., scientific studies:
>         - Studies into the nature of the mind
>         - Neuromodulators, or special chemicals like oxytocin, influence moral decisions
>         - Evidence can go towards supporting a theory of morality

# Normative Ethics

- Picks off where metaethics leaves off

> [!def]- Normative ethics
> - Studies *systems* of morality
> - Standards of right and wrong actions
> - One ultimate criterion of moral conduct in normative ethics:
>     - A set of rules or principles, usually

### Systems of Ethics

1. **Deontology**
2. **Consequentialism**
3. **Virtue ethics**

## Deontology

See [[Deontological Ethics]].

## Consequentialism

> [!def]- Consequentialism
> - Theory that the consequences of one’s conduct are the *ultimate basis* for any judgement about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct
> - Consequential theories are sometimes called **teleological** theories

### Utilitarianism

> [!def]- Utilitarianism
> - Ethical theory that states that the most moral action is one that *maximizes happiness and well-being* for the affected individuals

- Most popular consequentialist theory
- Developed by ==Jeremy Bentham== and ==John Stuart Mill== in the 18th century
- Actions should not be considered good or bad in and of themselves
    - only in *reference* to their **utility** i.e., usefulness in achieving happiness

See [[Utilitarianism]].

# Virtue Ethics

See [[Virtue Ethics]].

## Cardinal Virtues

Plato outlined:
1. Wisdom
2. Courage
3. Temperance
4. Justice

Aristotle argued:
- Most virtues fall between two extremes, which we ought to avoid
- e.g., Too much courage → become brash; too little → cowardly

# Applied Ethics

> [!def]- Applied ethics
> - Consists of the analysis of specific, controversial moral issues

- Today, applied ethics is often sorted into *subbranches* to deal with specific topics
    - e.g., medical ethics, business ethics, environmental ethics, or sexual ethics
- For example:
    - Medical ethics: embryonic stem cell research controversy, ending life support debate
    - Environmental ethics: shutting down specific emissions-producing businesses to stop global warming

## What Makes a Moral Issue an Applied Ethical Issue?

1. Issue needs to be **controversial**; nowhere near a consensus to a correct moral answer
    - e.g., “Theft is wrong” is generally agreed upon → would not fit into this category
2. Needs to be a direct moral issue i.e., **application**
    - e.g., Certain tax laws or zoning laws may be controversial, but are not directly moral in nature
