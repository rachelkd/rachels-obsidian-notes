## Animal Sentience

### ASENT

What is the ASENT project, and how does it approach the question of animal sentience in relation to animal welfare policy?

- The ASENT (Animal Sentience) project was led by researchers at the London School of Economics to study animal sentience from scientific, philosophical, and policy perspectives.
- ASENT defines sentience in two ways: broadly as “there being something it is like to be” an organism, and narrowly as the capacity to have positive and negative experiences.
- The project focuses on sentience as morally relevant for animal welfare policy, arguing that what matters is whether animals can suffer (not just register pain).
- ASENT developed criteria for determining sentience, including neurological criteria (nociceptors, integrative brain regions) and behavioural criteria (responses to painkillers, motivational trade-offs).
- The project had real policy impact, contributing to the UK’s expansion of animal welfare protection laws to include cephalopods and decapod crustaceans.
- ASENT researchers argue that pain without suffering is not morally relevant — what matters is whether an animal cares about its pain, not just whether pain receptors are firing.
- Ultimately, an understanding of what sentience is should follow the form of a scientific theory.
- Some researchers argue that we can make incremental progress towards questions about sentience by looking at what occurs at the biological level.
    - For example, it is important to ask what does sentience give you, and why did a species evolve to possess sentience?
    - However, we are pretty far from that point.
- The project takes a precautionary approach to animal welfare, suggesting we should assume sentience in cases of uncertainty when the potential harm of ignoring suffering is high.

### No Cortex No Cry

Explain the “No Cortex No Cry” argument regarding fish sentience, and how the concept of multiple realizability challenges this view.

- The “No Cortex No Cry” argument, proposed by Key (2016), claims that fish likely do not feel pain because they lack a neocortex.
- This argument is based on evidence from humans showing that pain experience correlates with activity in the neocortex, which is present in humans and mice but absent in fish.
- The argument follows a simple structure: a neocortex is necessary for pain, fish have no neocortex, therefore fish feel no pain.
- Critics counter this view by appealing to multiple realizability - the idea that the same mental function can be implemented by different physical structures.
- Multiple realizability suggests that suffering and other subjective experiences might be generated through various biological mechanisms, not just through a neocortex.
- Octopuses provide a compelling example of multiple realizability - they last shared a common ancestor with humans more than 500 million years ago and have radically different neural anatomy, yet demonstrate complex problem-solving and communication abilities.
- The challenge for those who appeal to multiple realizability is to explain “how multiply?”
    - Browning and Birch point out that single celled organisms avoid noxious substances and other dangers.
    - This behaviour in humans seems to suggest evidence of feelings.
    - However, the notion that single celled organisms are sentient is absurd.
    - If a person uses hand sanitizer, the assumption is that this is okay, since single-celled organisms do not have a nervous system.
    - However, multiple realizability argues that there could be different ways that suffering is realized in single-celled organisms.
- This debate highlights a fundamental problem in animal sentience research: how to determine which neural structures can support emotional experiences, and therefore, which animals are sentient.

### Sentience

How is sentience defined in animal welfare science, and why is it significant for both ethical and policy considerations?

- Browning and Birch define sentience in two ways.
    - The broad definition is that something is sentient if there is something it is like to be that organism.
    - The narrower definition is that an organism is capable of having positive and negative valanced experiences.
- In animal welfare science, sentience is important because it determines which animals deserve moral consideration and legal protections.
- Browning and Birch distinguish pain from suffering.
    - Pain refers to the actual firing of pain receptors.
    - Suffering is a condition where something cares about the pain that occurs.
- Browning and Birch argue that pain without suffering is not morally relevant.
    - This is similar to when a human undergoes surgery under anaesthesia, the pain does not matter because the person does not care about it.
- Sentience is the basis for many animal welfare laws globally, including in the UK, Canada, and New Zealand, which recognize animals as sentient beings.
- Browning and Birch propose a list of both neurological and behavioural criteria that indicates sentience:
    - Possession of nociceptors, which are sensory neurons that respond to injury or damage
    - Possession of integrative brain regions, which connects various parts of the nervous system and coordinates overall behaviour
    - Connections between nociceptors and integrative brain regions
        - There needs to be something that integrates the mere firing of pain receptors into a larger system of cognition and emotion.
    - The behavioural criteria includes:
        - Responses affected by local anaesthetics and painkillers
        - Motivational trade-offs that show a balancing of threat and opportunity for reward
        - Flexible self-protective behaviours
        - Associative learning beyond simply habituation and sensitization
            - Habituation is when a response to stimuli decreases over time, and sensitization refers to the opposite.
        - Behaviour that shows an animal values local anaesthetics when injured
- These criteria suggest that an animal cares about its own suffering beyond just the firing of nociceptors and reflex behaviours.
- It is important to note that meeting one criterion does not indicate sentience, but lacking one seems to be a disqualifier.
- The concept of sentience raises challenging scientific questions about how to measure subjective experiences that cannot be verbally reported in non-humans.
- In policy-making contexts, Browning and Birch propose a precautionary reasoning approach — assuming sentience when there is reasonable evidence, given the asymmetry of risk between ignoring real suffering and over-regulating.

### Multisensory Maps

How does the concept of multisensory maps help explain the evolutionary function of sentience, and what implications does this have for understanding consciousness in different species?

- Multi-sensory maps, proposed by Feinberg and Mallatt, offer a theoretical framework for understanding the biological function of conscious experience.
- This concept suggests that conscious experience evolved to organize and synthesize different streams of sensory information into a unified simulation of reality.
- This unified simulation provides organisms with a sense of what is important in their environment and helps determine behavioural options in novel situations.
- The multi-sensory maps approach suggests that sentience developed gradually in evolutionary history, with more sophisticated world models corresponding to more advanced forms of sentience.
- This view aligns with the Global Workspace Model, which proposes that what we experience is our brain’s best guess about what is happening around us - we experience the world model, not the world directly.
- Nervous systems are likely necessary for this kind of unified simulation, explaining why single-celled organisms (which can respond to stimuli but lack the machinery to build complex simulations) are not considered sentient.
- This approach offers a functional explanation for why consciousness might have evolved - it provides adaptive advantages through better integration of information and more flexible responses to environmental challenges.
- By focusing on the function of sentience rather than just its neural correlates, the multisensory maps concept provides a way to investigate sentience across species with different neural anatomies.

## Hindu Environmental Ethics

### Environmental Ethics

What is environmental ethics, and how does it distinguish between prudential and intrinsic obligations toward the natural environment?

- Environmental ethics is a sub-discipline that examines our ethical obligations toward the natural environment.
- It distinguishes between two forms of obligations: prudential obligations and intrinsic obligations.
    - Prudential obligations view the environment as a means to an end, such as keeping humans alive.
        - This represents anthropocentric reasoning, which places human at the center of ethical considerations.
        - For example, we should not burn forests or boil oceans because humans would likely die as a result.
    - Intrinsic obligations consider non-human living things for their own sake, recognizing that they have inherent value beyond their usefulness to humans.
        - This approach asks how much consideration we owe to the interests of non-human organisms.
- Environmental ethics can include considerations for humans, animals, plants, and sometimes even rivers and mountains.
- Some researchers and cultures have argued for legal personhood for natural entities like rivers, similar to how corporations are considered legal persons in some jurisdictions.
- A person has a definition of the law, and being a person entitles something or someone to certain protections.
    - Attributing legal personhood to an entity of the environment lowers the bar for direct harm.
    - Harm does not need to be tied to a person, but rather the entity itself.

### Ahimsa

How does the concept of ahimsa function in Hindu philosophy, and why is it considered a prerequisite for moksha?

- Ahimsa is a fundamental concept in Hindu philosophy that roughly translates to non-harm or non-violence.
- It functions as:
    - A prerequisite to moksha, which is liberation from the cycle of samsara (rebirth)
    - A virtue necessary for achieving deep self-knowledge
    - A principle that extends to all sentient beings
- Ahimsa is contrasted with himsa (violence), which is understood to produce negative karmic consequences for the person committing it and hinders progress toward moksha.
- While various Hindu schools differ in exactly that counts as ahimsa, the basic idea is not harming sentient beings.
- Hinduism attributes sentience widely across people, animals, and plants.
- In practice, ahimsa generally entails vegetarianism.
- Abstaining from meat consumption is highly valued, though not absolute, as parts of the Vedas involve gods killing animals for various reasons.
- The overwhelming view is to minimize harm as much as possible.
- The question arises to: why is it okay to eat plants?
    - Ahimsa in Jainism, a heterodox school of Indian philosophy, provides an explanation.
    - Jainists rank living things by the number of senses they have.
    - Therefore, it is more acceptable to eat plants because they have a lower number of senses and a lower complexity of experience of the world.

### The Last Man Argument

How does Richard Routley’s Last Man Argument challenge anthropocentrism and support the intrinsic value of non-human entities?

- The Last Man Argument, proposed by Richard Routley, challenges anthropocentrism by presenting a thought experiment:
    - Imagine the last surviving human, knowing they are the last and will soon die, decides to destroy as many living things as possible (including plants and animals) simply because it brings them pleasure.
    - If anthropocentrism — the concept that only humans have direct moral standing — is true, then since no other humans exist or will exist, the last person’s actions would be morally permissible.
    - Yet most people intuitively feel that such destruction is morally wrong, even when no humans are harmed.
- Framarin extends this argument by noting it works for both animals and plants.
    - Even if we imagine a scenario where all animals have perished and only plants remain, destroying an old-growth forest still seems morally wrong, even if it benefits the last human.
- This argument suggests that our moral intuition recognizes intrinsic value in non-human entities.
- Attempts to explain this intuition without granting intrinsic value to nature, such as arguing that the last person misses an opportunity for spiritual development, fail to capture the full moral weight of our disapproval, which seems directed at the destruction itself rather than at the last person’s character flaws.

### Sameness Interpretations

What is the Sameness Interpretation of Hindu environmental ethics, and why does Framarin argue it fails to establish direct moral standing for non-human entities?

- The Sameness interpretation argues that individual, living, non-human entities in nature have direct moral standing because they are, in some sense, the same as brahman.
    - Brahman is the universal principle behind all reality.
- The argument proceeds as follows:
    - Hindu texts claim that individual, living, non-human entities in nature are the same as brahman.
    - Brahman has direct moral standing.
    - If non-human entities are the same as brahman, and brahman has direct moral standing, then non-human entities have direct moral standing.
    - Therefore, Hindu texts claim that individual, living, non-human entities have direct moral standing.
- This interpretation suggests that we inherit our intrinsic value from our connection to the universal principle, brahman.
- Every being has atman, which can be loosely thought of as a soul or self, and atman is connected to brahman, giving each being moral standing.
- However, Framarin objects to this interpretation because brahman does not have “moral standing” in the same way individual living things do.
    - Nothing we can possibly do can hurt or help brahman.
    - Even the individual atman is unaffected by material concerns, as stated in the Bhagavadgita.
    - You can kill a body, but the atman is not killed.
- Framarin argues that moral responsibility implies that one can help or hurt the entity in question, but this cannot apply to brahman.
- Therefore, the Sameness interpretation fails to establish direct moral standing for non-human entities.

### Interconnection Interpretations

Explain Interconnection Interpretations of Hindu environmental ethics, and Framarin’s response to them.

- Framarin explores several Hindu ideas to propose a plausible environmental ethic.
- He requires that a plausible environmental ethic must attribute direct moral standing to individual, living, non-human entities in nature, such as animals and plants.
- Interconnection Interpretations argue that all of nature is interconnected, and this interconnectedness underwrites the moral status of animals and plants.
- The basic claim is that all beings are one, so harming one being is harming every being, which means that we should care about the interests of other beings.
- Deutsch argues that karma provides this interconnection.
    - An individual’s current actions have effects not only in the immediate present, but in the long future as well.
- Framarin objects to this interpretation because it misrepresents the doctrine of karma.
- In Hindu philosophy:
    - Karma connects your past and present actions to your current and future incarnations.
    - Karma links you to yourself at future times in future incarnations.
    - It does not particularly connect you to all other things
- Karma does not imply a degree of interconnection beyond what would be implied by the fact that we interact with other living things.
- The idea of rebirth might suggest that you should not eat animals, since you might one day be an animal yourself, but this is a prudential reason for ahimsa (which is understood to be non-violence), not an intrinsic one.
- Framarin concludes that the Interconnection Interpretations does not successfully attribute intrinsic value to non-humans.
- Instead, he argues that Hinduism provides a plausible environmental ethic simply because it attributes sentience across the living world and recognizes that it is bad to hurt sentient beings.

## Plant Intelligence

### Plant Movement

- Plant movement challenges traditional views about plant behaviour because it demonstrates that plants are not only passive organisms.
- While plants do not move like animals, they exhibit several forms of movement.
    - Some plants move on time-scales that humans can perceive. The mimosa pudica (“sensitive plant”) folds its leaves when touched, or Venus flytraps shuts itself.
    - Both of these plants respond to general anaesthetics, which meets one of the ASENT project’s behavioural criteria.
    - Some plants can also reorient their leaves during the night to face the direction of sunrise.
    - Root tips can also respond to stimuli by changing growth direction.
        - This suggests that there is something like a brain in plants that supports adaptive behaviour.
- Importantly, plant movements are not mechanical responses.
- They can be adaptive, flexible, anticipatory, and goal-directed.
- Some plants can respond differently to different stimuli.
    - Segundo-Ortin and Calvo point out that the Arbidopsis thaliana can distinguish between the sound of wind and caterpillar munching, and respond to caterpillars by synthesizing toxins.
- This challenges the traditional view that plants are passive and reactive organisms, instead suggesting that they actively engage with their environment in sophisticated ways.

### Plant Communication

- Plant communication refers to the exchange of information between plants and their environment through various mechanisms.
- Plants release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in response to stimuli (like damage) which triggers responses in both kin and non-kin.
    - For example, wild potatoes can change their VOC emissions when attacked by spider mites, attracting predatory mites from their flowers to go down to their leaves to eat the spider mites.
- Furthermore, trees increase tannin production in response to deer saliva but not to mechanical cutting.
    - They can also signal to other trees to increase tannin production via VOCs, which are chemicals that can be carried by the wind.
    - This seems like a defence mechanism.
    - Then, herbivores respond to this defence mechanism by moving upwind away from the trees with increased tannin production.
- Appel and Cocroft also claim that plants can detect specific vibration patterns.
    - The Arbidopsis thaliana can distinguish between vibrations caused by caterpillar munching versus wind through epidermal outgrowths called trichomes.
- While researchers are careful about anthropomorphizing these interactions between plants, Segundo-Ortin and Calvo claim that the evidence shows that plants have evolved sophisticated chemical signalling systems that allow them to respond adaptively to their environment and influence other organisms.
- They argue that this implies some form of plant intelligence.

### Plant Intelligence

- Segundo-Ortin and Calvo review evidence concerning plant cognition and present approaches to scientifically investigate plant consciousness.
- They claim that plant intelligence encompasses behavioural patterns that are adaptive, flexible, anticipatory, and goal-directed.
- Segundo-Ortin and Calvo evaluate plant intelligence through several criteria:
    - Decision-making,
    - Anticipatory behaviour,
    - Learning and memory,
    - Foraging and competition, and
    - Communication
- Plants integrate multiple environmental variables to determine optimal growth strategies
    - For example, the C. canadiensis can discriminate between different habitat conditions, choosing environments with the best combination of light, warmth, and low competition.
    - This aligns nicely with the ASENT project’s criteria for determining sentience: motivational trade-offs that show a balancing of threat against opportunity for reward.
- Gagliano’s study on pea plants suggests that pea plants can learn to associate fans with light.
    - This aligns with the ASENT criteria that requires an indication of associative learning beyond habituation and sensitization.
    - However, this study failed to replicate in Markel (2020).
- Researchers in plant intelligence are careful to distinguish between anthropomorphic interpretations and biologically grounded observations of complex, adaptive behaviours.
- Segundo-Ortin and Calvo focus on how plants process environmental information rather than assuming human-like cognitive processes.

### Goal-Directed

- Walsh argues that for something to be truly goal-directed, it should have three properties:
    - Persistence
    - Plasticity
    - Repertoire
- The system should persistently pursue a goal, returning to that pursuit if perturbed.
- The system should be able to use flexible strategies to achieve its goals
- The system should have a wide range of possible behaviours to draw from.
- The concept of goal-directedness is important for discussions of plant sentience.
    - While mechanical systems like the Watt Governor have extrinsic goals (which are imposed by humans), plants appear to have intrinsic goals related to their survival and reproduction.
    - The C. canadiensis can discriminate between different habitat conditions, choosing environments with the best combination of light, warmth, and low competition.
    - Some plants can, in a sense, move their leaves at night to face the sunrise.
- If plants have goals, then they have interests — things they “want” from the world — which raises moral questions about whether these interests deserve ethical consideration.
- Goal directed behaviour that meets Walsh’s criteria goes beyond simple equilibrium-seeking (like a ball rolling to the bottom of a bowl) and suggests more complex information processing.
- While goal-directed behaviour alone does not necessarily indicate sentience (as defined by ASENT criteria), it does suggest that plants have interests and adaptive capabilities that go beyond simple mechanical responses to stimuli, which is relevant to ethical discussions about plant consciousness.

## Animacy and Inanimacy

### Spontaneous Generation

- Spontaneous generation refers to the historical belief that living organisms could arise regularly from non-living matter.
- Until the 19th century, European tradition held that living things could spontaneously emerge from non-living substances via the spontaneous generation of life.
- For example, frogs could emerge from mud or snakes from decomposing human spines.
- Aristotle believed in the barrier between living and non-living was permeable, allowing non-living matter to transform into living organisms
- This view persisted, with Pliny the Elder also claiming that a particular wind could impregnate sheep, tigers, and other animals.
- While modern biology acknowledges that life must have originated from non-living systems at least once in Earth’s history, it rejects the idea that this happens regularly in nature.

### “Animism”

- Animism was a term coined by Edward Burnett Taylor.
- The term was used to describe Indigenous worldviews that attributed life, consciousness, or spiritual qualities to entities that Western science considered inanimate.
- Taylor subscribed to “evolutionism” (as defined by Herbert Spencer), which viewed societies as progressing from simple to complex forms.
- Within this framework, animism was characterized as a “primitive” belief system of “lesser races” that would eventually evolve into the supposedly “high worldviews” of European cultures.
- This characterization was fundamentally flawed and ethnocentric.
    - The term, animism, functioned as an insult disguised as a scientific concept, implying that Indigenous peoples incorrectly attributed animacy too widely.
- Today, the term has falling out of favour in anthropology, though some attempts have been made to revive it as “neo-animism” without the pejorative connotations.
    - However, Wilkinson claims these attempts remain problematic because they still frame Indigenous perspectives as alternative to a presumed “correct” Western view.

### Anishinaabe Protocols for Gathering Materials from Plants and Trees

- The Anishinaabe protocols for gathering plant materials are a set of traditional practices that the Anishinaabeg use to interact with botanical beings when collecting their parts for food, medicine, or other uses.
- These protocols reflect the Anishinaabe worldview that plants and trees have personhood and sentience, and are deserving of respect and proper relationship
- The protocols include:
    - making an offering of tobacco before gathering,
    - directly addressing the plant to ask permission for harvesting,
    - explaining to the plant why its materials are needed, and
    - promising to take only what is necessary and ensuring enough remains for the plant to survive
- Sometimes, the Anishinaabeg sing specific songs taught by ancestors or spirits when gathering certain materials
- Consent is not always given, and there is not a definitive set of rules that indicate that permission is not given.
- However, Geniusz provides some examples of refusal such as unusual difficulties in gathering, or a bee flying into a flower and dropping dead.
- These protocols are important because they demonstrate a different understanding of the relationship between humans and the plant world compared to dominant Western perspectives.
- The Anishinaabeg believe that plants are not simply resources to be used, but persons with agency who can grant or withhold permission.
- This consent is necessary practically, as medicines are believed to work effectively only when the plant has willingly offered its healing properties.
- These protocols reflect the broader Anishinaabe concept of inaadiziwin (way of being) and contribute to the maintaining of the “balance of the world” — a primary ethical good in which all elements of nature play their interconnected roles

## Strange Agents

### “Neurons didn’t Invent Cognition — They Optimized it”

- Baluska and Levin argue that all biological systems — at any level or organization — are cognitive agents.
- They define cognition as the set of mechanisms and processes that underlie information acquisition, storing, processing, and use, at any level of organization.
- Then, the criteria for being cognitive is really basic: you just need some kind of information processor to be considered cognitive.
- Baluska and Levin present a way to think about cognition in systems without a brain, any neurons, or even a central nervous system.
- This slogan argues that CNS neurons do not embody cognition due to any magical, unique property.
- That is, neurons do not produce cognition simply because they are neurons or apart of the brain or CNS
- Rather, Baluska and Levin argue that neurons have cognitive capacities because it is a system that can transmit and integrate signals and update its configuration based on prior activity i.e., process information.
- This signal-interpreting and configuration-updating capacity is present throughout biological systems.
- While neurons might be the ‘best’ at cognition, they did not invent it, and they are not the only biological system that have cognition.
- There are more simpler systems in the human and animal body that can do the same thing.

### Bioelectricity

- Baluska and Levin argue that the brain has cognitive capacities because it is a system that transmit and integrate signals and update its configuration based on prior activity.
- Developmental bioelectricity refers to how electrical signals regulate the development of cells and tissue.
    - Neurons communicate with each other using action potentials, which are rapid changes in electric voltages.
    - Action potentials in developmental bioelectricity is vastly present across the biological world, such as in bacteria, plants, and in a single cell.
- As living systems harness electricity in this specific way, Levin understands bioelectricity as a unifying principle in biology
- Cognition is information-processing, and information processing in living systems occurs via bioelectric signals.
- Therefore, studying bioelectricity should tell us something insightful about cognition
- Levin also claims that a better understanding of bioelectricity will dissolve disciplinary distinctions between brain sciences and biology

### Intentional Stance
