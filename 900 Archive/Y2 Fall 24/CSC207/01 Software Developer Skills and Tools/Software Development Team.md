>     - Where persistent *data is stored*
>     - How data passes between the parts of the program
> - Create the screens
>     - What does this look like from the user experience?
>     - Match a **high-fidelity** prototype that someone else created
>     - Add functionality
>         - e.g., What happens when a button is clicked?
> - Test
>
> > [!question]+ Stuff to ponder
> > 1. How do devs know what user interfaces to create?
> > 2. How do devs know what data to keep track of?
> > 3. How do devs know that they are creating what the client wants?
> > - This is where the team comes in!

>         - Focus on usability and user flow
>         - e.g., no colours or other such details
>     - Can end user accomplish all the use cases?
>     - Allows software devs to start planning

>     - Most companies would be concerned if left to individual dev → often has a quality assurance role
> - Review specification and ensure adherence
> - Test software on different browsers, screen sizes, network conditions
> - Try to break the software
