### Introduction
The One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project, initiated by researchers at the  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has famously aimed to provide low cost, rugged laptops as means of ‘‘creating educational opportunities for the  
world’s poorest children’’ (The OLPC Wiki 2008) and to do so at a massive  
scale. Though OLPC’s original distribution strategy was to sell laptops to  
national governments for distribution in schools, many countries ultimately  
pulled out of the project, citing the final laptop as too expensive or too risky.  
As a result, OLPC has appealed to tech-enthusiast donors in wealthier coun-  
tries to ‘‘give one, get one’’—purchasing a laptop for themselves as well as  
a child in a recipient country.  
A recent video advertisement for the program depicts Asian and  
African children hunched in manual labor before cutting to an African boy  
dressed shooting an automatic firearm at glass bottles while the narrator  
tells us ‘‘Kids learn fast.’’ The images suggest that third world children  
of color are currently learning two things quickly: manual labor and vio-  
lence. The ad then cuts to African boys wearing collared shirts engrossed  
in the iconically green XO laptop as the narrator exhorts: ‘‘Let’s give them  
the right tools’’ (Figure 1). 1  
The advertisement tells a fairly straightforward technologically determi-  
nist story—the laptop can turn the lives of these children around, perhaps,  
because it will open doors to different life paths, away from manual labor  
and violence to middle class knowledge work. At 30 seconds, some may  
argue that tropes of lack and aspiration expediently compel audiences to  
donate. How does the problem framing contribute to the ad’s efficacy? The video reduces child labor to a question of permission or prohibition,  
rather than a network of questions about how, why, in what political econ-  
omy or which contexts. Other possible questions remain unheard: Could the  
shooting child be part of a conflict over water access as usable local rivers  
become scarce? What labor conditions enable the manufacture of such an  
inexpensive laptop? Do these children labor to get the cash that enables the  
supply of Monsanto seeds, tied into land ownership, irrigation strategies,  
and techniques? Complex and heterogeneous socioeconomic situations are  
universalized into a unitary category: the underdeveloped child. Under-  
standing opportunity in these children’s worlds would require an investiga-  
tion of particular locations—drawing on history, political economy, and  
ethnography, and specific resource, community, and technology dynamics.  
OLPC is one of many government, corporate, and nonprofit programs  
promoting Information and Communciation Technology for Development  
(ICT4D). The video calls our attention to popular narratives of computation  
and practices of information design. We suggest that this high-profile exam-  
ple of using computers for development is symptomatic of situations we call  
Postcolonial Computing.
#### Why Postcolonial?
Reading some common—one might call them hegemonic—forms of post-  
colonial computing, this article offers a few tactics for rereading, rewriting,  
or reimagining those scripts. Our reimagined model is also called Postcolo-  
nial Computing. That is, we see critique and rewriting as part of the same  
tactical process. We offer no absolute escape from ideology, no newly  
‘‘appropriate’’ technologies or quick cultural fixes. Postcolonial Computing  
is a bag of tools that affords us contingent tactics for continual, careful, col-  
lective, and always partial reinscriptions of a cultural–technical situation in  
which we all find ourselves.  
What is it about this cultural–technical situation in which we find ourselves  
that necessitates the deployment of such tactics? There is much about it that  
recalls the history of colonial technology transfers and of the assimilation of  
local knowledges. But we suggest that an important element of the novelty  
of our situation lies in recent developments in computational design. We will  
return to this point, developing our arguments and examples through compu-  
tational design practices. But first, we explore why the analysis of this cul-  
tural–technical situation might call for the use the tools of postcolonial studies.  
Why borrow from postcolonial theory? 2 Science and Technology Stud-  
ies (STS) has over the past two decades refined a set of complex methodologies for the symmetrical study of truth and error that handily  
gets around the Enlightenment myths of abstract Reason and Western  
Rationality. 3 STS methods are widely used now, to understand technology  
and science, but parallel developments in humanities theory illuminate  
cultural dynamics understudied in STS. This postcolonial cultural–technical  
situation encompasses the entirety of the world we live in, shaped by the  
post–World War II atomic age, numerous mid-twentieth-century decoloniza-  
tions, the Bretton Woods era, the 1970s oil crisis, post-Fordism, neoliberal-  
ism, new technologies and their attendant time-space compression, and  
new forms of global migration in which the flows of people, goods, and ideas  
took on formations different from those of previous eras of slavery, colonial-  
ism, and occupation.4 All these and more led to the rewriting of practically  
every discipline in the humanities, giving voice to previously silenced fram-  
ings of humanity and society. Science, technology, economics, and the  
‘‘hard’’ disciplines, however, remained less susceptible to such rewritings and  
stood apart from the general ferment that became tagged as post-  
structuralism, postmodernism, postcolonialism, and so on. STS did take on  
the hard bastions of objectivity, transforming Euro-American sociology, his-  
tory, and philosophy. However, much of the mythos of the Western origin  
stories of science and rationality, while being demolished in theory, mani-  
fested itself in practice, in a locational focus on Euro-American spaces of sci-  
ence. Even when scholars began to study other locations, there remained what  
Warwick Anderson characterized as a ‘‘semiotic formalism,’’ in which ‘‘the  
‘local’ can seem quite abstract, depleted of historical and social specificity.’’  
Studies implicitly assumed that the origins and practices of scientific truth  
could be fully articulated in Western contexts, and that an expansion to  
non-Western case studies would not significantly shift paradigmatic models.  
A version of the ‘‘mix and stir’’ method thus characterized many attempts to  
globalize the scope of STS. We suggest that postcolonial science studies can  
do more than expand answers to questions already posed; it can generate dif-  
ferent questions and powerfully different ways of looking at the  
world.5  
To illustrate, we draw on the already rich histories and anthropologies  
of colonial and postcolonial technoscience. Below, we offer some analytical  
and practical tactics. Though drawn primarily from computing, these tactics  
invite translation and adaptation.
#### Why computing?
As our opening example suggested, OLPC represents and reimagines the  
knowledge economy, offering computing as a tool for entering it. Postcolonial computational sites such as these, as well as their associated  
forms of practice, organization, and design, offer opportunities for under-  
standing postcolonial technoscience more generally.
#### Postcolonial Computing for them; plain vanilla computing for us?
Postcolonial Computing is not simply about the failure of good intentions  
via inadequate design, a liberal remedy for the illiberal error of prejudice,  
or an etiquette handbook for culturally ‘‘ignorant’’ designers. While the his-  
tory of such errors and ignorance is certainly germane to any discussion of  
global technology, our main concern here is quite different.  
First, Postcolonial Computing does not hold that design over ‘‘there’’ is  
fundamentally different from design ‘‘here.’’ Researchers located in the  
West might appear to be the most productive innovators, while those in  
the developing world might appear at first glance to be simply adopting  
Western diffusions. However, on a closer look, both sides of this dichot-  
omy are seen to be composed of contradictory stratifications, articula-  
tions, and meanings. There is no essential character or single ‘‘here’’ of  
Western knowledge and design. Nor is design ‘‘everywhere’’ converging  
inexorably to the shape of ‘‘here;’’ difference abounds. On one hand, we  
notice methodological innovations everywhere, suggesting commonal-  
ities across the West and the ‘‘Rest.’’ On the other hand, incommensur-  
ability appears to mark relations not only across cultures but within  
them. As similarities and differences cross cultural boundaries, the bound-  
aries themselves are called into question.  
Postcolonial Computing advocates a focus not simply on the negative  
critique of constructions of cultural difference, but on the productive possi-  
bilities of ‘‘difference’’ itself. The seams among differences are not simply  
a source of undesirable unevenness and aberration, but also sites of creativ-  
ity and possibility.  
Second, Postcolonial Computing does not seek to transform design  
methods ‘‘there’’ by adapting supposedly culture-free Western design to  
supposedly culture-laden non-Western contexts. We approach design  
practice as a complex practice of translation. Translation has a dual  
meaning: the linguistic sense captures the transformation between different  
languages—culturally situated representational schemes; the geometric  
sense refers to the movement of a figure from place to place. Design  
methods as portable prescriptions of practice presume that translation pre-  
serves meaning. Instead, we draw attention to the purposeful, partial, and situated work that legitimately translates ways of life into technological  
needs and mandates.  
Third, Postcolonial Computing does not merely advocate critical atten-  
tion to computational design products (software packages, games, etc.)  
Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) research has already recognized the  
cultural specificity of design products, and this is an important step. How-  
ever, the processes and methods of design are still considered universal.  
Methods of ‘‘user-centered’’ or ‘‘appropriate’’ design presume the logic  
of a God’s eye view and an agentic designer. Taking a broader view, we  
argue that methods—the products of research communities, economic  
actors, and educational practices that span the globe—are always transnation-  
ally produced in situ. We view designers, planners, makers, the objects they  
shape, and a range of diverse users, as part of an assemblage. This assemblage  
includes not only the dreams of design but the messiness of manufacture as  
well. It links materials sourcing, the context of making, and legal regimes,  
with the historical fields of discourse that make computational design possi-  
ble today. Just as STS has highlighted the need to examine the socially situ-  
ated and contingent nature of scientific practice, so we want to draw attention  
to the dynamics and contingencies of design methods, in order better to  
understand how they might be subject to new forms of translation, transfor-  
mation, and reconfiguration.  
Our goal is to broaden the conversation about technology development  
by placing it in a theoretical and transnational context without relying  
on dualisms such as developed/developing, traditional/scientific, or  
colonial/postcolonial. Akhil Gupta illustrates the empirical inadequacy  
of such dualities in his account of entangled chemical and humoral Indian  
farming knowledges (1988). Hybrid communication is multidirectional in  
his stories, and technological encounters take place over years and  
decades. Attentiveness to the emergence of similar hybrid practices in  
information technology design can help render design more locally legible  
and contextually effective.  
Our goal is not simply to bemoan the problems that arise when methods  
fail to move easily and stably from one setting to another but to understand  
design efforts as always already processes of hybridization. While many  
translational design problems arise primarily in ‘‘obvious’’ postcolonial  
contexts—in ICT4D projects, for example—our arguments are broader in  
scope. Hybridizing encounters happen not only across seams of national dif-  
ference but also across other seams. For example, anthropologist Lucy  
Suchman (2002) framed the work that she and her colleagues conducted  
at Xerox as the staging of encounters among various stakeholders, including engineers and workers. This suggests the broader relevance of a focus on  
hybrid knowledge practice, via understandings of power, history, identity,  
and epistemology.  
Recombinations of STS, Information Studies, and Postcolonial Studies  
have been productive before. In 1994, Suchman opened a paper on software  
systems design by quoting STS theorists Langdon Winner and Donna  
Haraway. Her paper’s primary audience was in ‘‘Computer Supported Colla-  
borative Work.’’ Suchman invoked Winner’s insights into the ways in which  
technological artifacts embody the politics of their design and development,  
and Haraway’s demonstrations of how contingency, partiality, and heteroge-  
neity capture something important about technoscientific practice, in order to  
make original claims about the future of ICT design. Extending Winner, she  
noted that ‘‘technology’’ suggests only objects but also their associated  
human/technical practices. Suchman also invoked Foucault, and cited the  
achievements of ‘‘postcolonial STS,’’ showing that human subjectivity, like  
technology, is an outcome of historically specific practices. In this article, as  
in others since, she has implicitly held that humans and technological objects  
can be analyzed in a common rubric, rather than separated by disciplinary  
categories. Following her, we do not assume the unique application of  
Humanities for human analysis and Informatics for technological analysis.  
Suchman’s work illustrates how interdisciplinary borrowings lead not  
simply to the replication of an insight from one field in another but to  
reframings that produce new insights across both disciplines. Her analyses  
offer implications for how designers deal with computational categories, for  
how humanists might read Foucault, and for how programmers interpret  
Haraway’s unruly universe. Postcolonial interdisciplinary practice can pro-  
voke alternate models of analysis and practice.
#### Non-computable complexities?
Most disciplines have built-in procedures to avoid problems of complexity  
that are too hard to handle within their methodological frameworks. Thus, it  
may seem counterproductive to render a seamless narrative seamful, to rela-  
tivize a universal explanation, or to destabilize a sedimented claim. Does  
not this method produce a non-computable problem? For all its flaws, are  
not science and technology working for our betterment, and is not this quib-  
bling simply another act of sabotage—the throwing of an intellectual sabot  
into the technical machine?  
Information designers would be justified in asking for a road map  
through this deeply specific yet unremittingly abstract model of Postcolonial Computing. Rather than offering Postcolonial Computing as a  
new ideal or a Novum Organum for the information age, we sketch out a  
pragmatic set of tactics, below. 6 What is at stake is the very practical, every-  
day practice of observing, analyzing, and working with natural, physical,  
informatic, and cultural systems. 
Tactic 1: When we see a technoscientific object, we investigate its contin-  
gency not only locally but in the infrastructures, assemblages, and  
political economies that are the conditions of its possibility (Figure 2)7  
.  
Tracing the long networks that enable technological formations is essential  
to a postcolonial account of technologies (Anderson 2002). When part of  
the assemblage seems to be taken for granted rather than seen as contingent,  
we ask why.  
The first picture above depicts technological objects in use in a specific  
context. What are the conditions of possibility of this moment? The OLPC  
came to these two girls in part through the much publicized efforts of  
Nicholas Negroponte and open source coders, through the navigation of  
media and social networks, through sometimes antagonistic negotiations  
with software and hardware producers, and a dense assemblage of other  
forces and actors. In the second image, we see a rarer peek into the assembly  
lines of computing in a photo that stages the celebration of the XO’s depar-  
ture from design phases into manufacture and deployment. These paired  
images are a study in contrasting tropes—foreground/background, effect/  
infrastructure, authorship-use/execution, and ingenuity/routine. The photo  
on the right is the indication of the standing reserves of feminized Asian labor that manufactures the XO laptop, like many of the world’s computers.  
The women’s labors are part of the conditions of possibility of the girls’ use  
of the XO. Such labors are hardly attended to in ICT4D or HCI. Infrastruc-  
tured, the women’s labor recedes into the background of consciousness to  
be taken for granted in use (Star 1999). Practically oriented engineers,  
designers, and STS practitioners can take them for granted because these  
women and their labors are held in an assemblage that is fixed, taken for  
granted, and consistently available, rather than visibly contested, contin-  
gent, and uneven.  
Why do unstable, contingent relations appear as fixed and inevitable?  
Stories about the networked travels of technological objects reveal layers  
of information about the power relations that enable those networks. Often,  
the labor and natural resources needed to produce computers has gone unex-  
amined. As Warwick Anderson has suggested, ‘‘Postcolonial studies of sci-  
ence and technology might offer opportunities to generate systemic  
understandings of political economies . . . or at least they might offer us  
threads to follow through the labyrinth.’’ (2002, 652). The labyrinth, or the  
network, is forged of connections made up of secretaries, semiconductor  
manufacturing workers, railroad systems, data centers, trade agreements,  
arms dealers, and other hybrids. These appear as background to the heroic  
actors (programmers, marketers, and users, in this XO story), because they  
are held as if on ‘‘stand by, to be immediately at hand, indeed to stand there  
just so that it may be on call for a further ordering’’ (Heidegger 1977).  
These standbys are not the character actors who have found their voices  
in numerous network narratives or laboratory ethnographies. The origin  
stories of the standing reserves of nature and labor are part of the narratives  
one must unravel in Postcolonial Computing. 
Tactic 2: When we see a technoscientific regime coalescing, we look for  
work that is out of the bounds of this regime.
During the 1970s and 1980s, Brazil instituted special market protections for  
computer manufacturers, providing privileged market access to firms that  
designed computers within Brazil. Brazilian lawmakers had translated the  
consumption of artifacts designed outside of the country as an economic  
vulnerability and, additionally, a cause of poverty. A Brazilian company  
called Unitron responded to these incentives by reverse engineering and man-  
ufacturing a Macintosh computer clone they named ‘‘Mac de periferia.’’  
Though Apple had no intellectual property protection for the Macintosh in  
Brazil, the American corporation was able to pressure government and other economic actors within Brazil to reframe Unitron’s activities, once seen as  
nationalist and anti-colonial, as immoral piracy. In exerting political pressure  
through its economic strength, Apple was able to reshape notions of author-  
ship to exclude reverse engineering and modification, realigning Brazilian  
notions of intellectual authorship with American notions that privilege desig-  
nated originators over maintainers and modifiers of code and hardware archi-  
tecture (da Costa Marques 2005).  
The story of Mac de Periferia foregrounds a question about invention:  
What counts as new? The assignment of novelty lies at the heart of how we  
value technological work. Novelty is far from obvious in some cases, con-  
tested in everyday talk (Suchman 2008) as well as in intellectual property  
trials. The answer to this question has implications for the transnational polit-  
ical economy of technoculture. We can trace the importance of legal and tech-  
nical regimes by tracing the boundaries of what counts as innovative/imitative.  
Unitron’s work was not only an appropriation and translation of software  
knowledge produced in Cupertino. It was also a response to contemporary  
conditions surrounding intellectual property and the economics of software  
production.8 International trade regimes often enforce alignments of  
regimes of control and ownership of knowledge. The diffusion of computa-  
tional design practice is not a simple transfer of technology between cultural  
settings but a hybrid translation process enabled by the global circuits  
through which people, capital, and goods are already flowing. The eco-  
nomic benefits of these alignments and partnerships flow unevenly. Uni-  
tron’s activities were simultaneously a technological design process, a  
form of political resistance, and a sociotechnical attempt to redress an eco-  
nomic unevenness, taking place in a field conditioned by political economic  
flows and active legal and cultural negotiations about innovation.  
Unitron had performed intellectual and material labor in responding to  
local policy incentives, reverse engineering the Mac, and figuring out how  
to reliably manufacture it using local skills, materials, and infrastructures.  
This is the work—‘‘integration, local configuration, customization, mainte-  
nance, and redesign’’—that Suchman (2002) argues has been kept outside  
the legible boundaries of ‘‘professional design.’’ The legal dismissal of  
articulation work by international forces in this case mirrors a broader cul-  
tural dismissal of articulation work, seen as a place where real innovation  
does not happen. In contrast, Suchman underscores the importance of local  
improvisation in technology production: ‘‘Local improvisation . . . is not  
just a matter of receiving something already made and incorporating it into  
a new site of use . . . . Rather, improvisational activities are the generative  
practices out of which new technologies are made’’ (Suchman 2002). Questioning ‘‘innovation’’ and its invocations of originality opens up  
new spaces of inquiry into technocultural practices. How does something  
come to count as innovative or original? How do certain kinds of work, such  
as reverse engineering, call center technical support, or ‘‘rote’’ mathe-  
matics, come to be seen as the opposite of innovation? In what kinds of  
moral and legal economies do designations of innovation circulate?  
What might we learn about innovation and the subtleties of technological  
embeddings by studying those technologies that are considered ‘‘copies’’  
rather than the original? What are the political economic consequences of  
technojuridical or technocultural categories such as copy and original, inno-  
vation and derivation? What would we learn about political philosophy and  
the scripting of technological objects by studying those who crack software  
codes and violate their terms of service in different ecological and discur-  
sive milieus?  
Apple is said to have derived its own innovations from the Star, devel-  
oped by Xerox PARC. Xerox sued Apple for infringement in 1989 (Fisher).  
But that history is only known because there are voices familiar with PARC,  
who could circulate that story in powerful networks. In what ways are con-  
cepts of ownership and means of settling questions of ownership negligent  
of subaltern technologies and relations of property that were not noticed,  
archived, or defended when their derivatives were claimed as novel? Thus  
when we see legal, technological, and other systems coalescing to form a  
discrete regime of computational practice, we understand it via that which  
is drawn out of its boundaries. As the concept of innovation is elucidated by  
stories of copying, so other technoscientific regimes can be recast by inves-  
tigating those negative spaces they exclude.  
Tactic 3: When we see claims of inherent technological and cultural dif-  
ference, we apply STS methods symmetrically to both the technology  
and the culture at hand. But we do not stop there; we proceed to  
deconstruct the binary between technology and culture and study the  
impure crossings between them.  
Erin, a business analyst at a large Internet company in the United States,  
describes collaborating with teams in India to locate promising customers.  
The Indian employees had been tasked with identifying upgrade leads—  
existing customers with whose businesses might benefit from an increased  
level of service. After a few weeks of this collaboration, the U.S. team  
found that the businesses identified by Indian colleagues lacked what they  
considered good business models. The Web sites were not ‘‘well designed,’’ their technologies were not ‘‘exciting,’’ and their brands were unrecognizable  
to the Americans. Because they were in headquarters, the U.S. employees  
ultimately determined what counted as a legitimate lead but were unable to  
convey it to the Indian team in a way that helped them come up with more  
satisfactory leads. The U.S. team worked around these misunderstandings  
by asking the Indian employees to do highly formalized, quantitative analysis  
and computational tasks since such tasks left less room for ambiguity. ‘‘They  
are strong at math but less good at things that require some gut judgment,’’  
Erin explains of her Indian colleagues.  
As technologies and collaborations around them have come to span  
national boundaries, cultural encounters such as Erin’s have come into  
focus, recurring in our fieldwork. Erin understands the situation by recourse  
to a familiar story that understands Indians, like stereotyped Asians more  
broadly, as technically proficient but lacking business intuition. A larger  
assumption of national homogeneity and difference undergirds the account.  
Technologists in ICT4D and HCI, as well as organizational scholars,  
have confronted thorny problems in intercultural collaboration and design  
that they have tried to resolve through a taxonomic model that sees culture  
as something that is inherently stable enough to be fixed as an invariant.9  
The stable differences claimed by taxonomic models of culture have their  
corollaries and echoes in some forms of user-centered design that strive  
to fit technologies to a stabilized notion of the user (Berg 1998). The focus  
on ‘‘cultural difference’’ as a topic for system design has sought to under-  
stand cultural characteristics so they may render culture as manageable in  
the software design process. Cultures have been taxonomized to fit manage-  
rial purposes since the early days of colonial anthropology (Goh 2006).  
Postcolonial Computing begins with the recognition that the categories  
on which taxonomic models are built, such as female, Asian, or human,  
do not exist independently of technology. Rather, what it means to be  
American, or Indian, is often deeply entangled with power, institutions, and  
technologies. Technologies such as language and radio emerged as techno-  
cultural productions and themselves have been instrumental in the imagina-  
tion, creation, and maintenance of nation-states (Mra ́zek 1997; Siegel  
1997). Media technologies in part constitute the very cultural categories  
by which some seek to explain them.  
Understanding these categories’ historical contingency blurs taxonomic  
borders and generates new kinds of questions. We see ways in which these  
categories are not inherent attributes of people or groups, but instead differ-  
ent positions in relation to multiple flows of people, capital, discourses, and  
media—flows and phenomena that can change over time. Postcolonial conditions underscore the cross-cultural encounters such as migration,  
media flows, extraction, and trade, which generate hybridities, conflicts,  
hidden resistances, and even cooperation and complicity (Gandhi 1998)  
at many different scales.  
This methodological practice continues the process of tracking crossings  
between the narratives at hand and others in the shadows, between those in  
and out of the frame. It implies a generative, rather than taxonomic, view  
of culture—one where the cultural is produced and reproduced as people col-  
lectively encounter the world, a system of interpretive signification that ren-  
ders the world intersubjectively meaningful and object-filled (Barad 2003).  
From this view, an individual may participate in many cultures—cultures  
of ethnicity, nationhood, profession, class, gender, kinship, and history—each  
of which, with its logics and narratives, frame the experience of everyday life.  
The goal, thus, is not to classify people and place them on a scale, but rather  
to understand how the technological objects and knowledge practices of  
everyday life arise as contingent, processual and dynamic materializations. Tactic 3, Corollary: When we see an instance of indigenous science or  
‘‘native’’ technology, we investigate it not as an instance of inherent  
difference or autochthonous authenticity but as a practice with the  
same epistemological status as putatively Western sciences. In other  
words, our categories, while always subject to grounded interrogation  
and theoretical critique, emerge from assumptions of diachronic  
imbrication rather than synchronic incommensurability. India is probably the only country in the world where you can send e-mail to a  
person who doesn’t have access to the Internet, a computer, phone, or heck,  
even electricity. And, how? For Rs 10 and an A4 sheet, postmen will receive,  
print and hand deliver e-mail anywhere in India (or vice versa), typically  
within a day. How do you provide ‘last mile connectivity’ in a nation where  
only six percent of the people can access the Net and fewer still can read?  
India Posts’ admirable reply would be: ‘With our feet, and privacy be  
damned.’ It’s jugaad. (Ramachandran 2009)
Jugaad is what some Indians call an indigenous form of innovation.  
A word with many definitions, it often implies a problem worked around,  
a solution jury-rigged, and social connections and materials put to uses few  
could have imagined.  
Some root jugaad in persistence and improvisational skill while others  
cite it as an approach honed in environments where scarcity and limited product choice characterize daily life. ‘‘Perhaps the jugaad gene is  
hardwired into Indians as an evolutionary adaptation for an environment  
in which things, more often than not, fail to work—if you want to get things  
done, you have to learn to reconnoitre your way around poorly designed and  
executed processes and systems,’’ writes The Hindu Business Line. 10 In  
recent years, jugaad has become something of a banner for a post-1990s  
India establishing itself as a global innovator. Nasscom, India’s IT business  
processing outsourcing (BPO) chamber of commerce, summarizes jugaad  
as an evolving business aesthetic rooted in scarcity, characterized by  
adaptability and relentless experimentation, and increasingly incorporating  
‘‘analytical’’ and ‘‘strategic’’ approaches (Sharma 2007). The jury-rigged  
scooters and cell phones rescued from the precipice of obsolescence have  
drawn attention from bloggers, the Wall Street Journal, Indian  
businessmen-cum-authors, and designers seeking a form of innovation that  
they can designate as characteristically Indian.  
What might it mean, then, to speak of indigenous or ‘‘native’’ knowl-  
edge? ‘‘Indigeneity,’’ like ‘‘reason,’’ can be a strategically invoked designa-  
tion. Whether ‘‘indigenous’’ or ‘‘scientific,’’ ways of knowing the world  
and practically encountering it also have symbolic resonances that are part  
of the performances of those knowledges. To act in a way others recognize  
as jugaad may be a matter of making the unlikely happen, but it can also be  
pleasurable or strategic essentialism. While it is tempting to assign instru-  
mentality primary priority in considering technological practices in differ-  
ent cultural settings, the trafficking of jugaad suggests that performing  
knowledges can take on other resonances and circulate in other moral and  
symbolic economies. When Indians describe jugaad as innovation, in what  
ways is their assertion of sameness a mode of provisionally constructing  
commensurability, or as Helen Verran puts it ‘‘local, particular, and contin-  
gent symmetry’’ (2002, 731), so that difference can be asserted as well?  
When we consider alternate rationalities and epistemologies, what ‘‘com-  
plex and situated definition of rationality’’ does justice to their nuances  
in context (Philip 2001)? How is sharing knowledge a way of expressing  
identity, respect, sensibility, or trust? How are these very categories inade-  
quate to convey the nuances of the many registers in which knowledge and  
technique are performed? Is jugaad evidence of incommensurably different  
design cultures? Is jugaad a manner of observing opportunity and taking  
action that represents an inherently different attitude to design, a hard-  
wired indigenous skill? Even while provincializing rationality, how do  
we avoid reducing postcolonial knowledges to that which is fully commen-  
surable with STS practitioners’ expectations? We argue against positing essential difference and caution against  
deploying one particular model of hybridity to represent a whole national  
or cultural design sensibility. All contexts are heterogeneous. Bricolage and  
articulation have always characterized technology design. We read ascriptions  
of hybridity and indigeneity as something other than originary and essential.  
Incorporating hybridity into design practice requires a reconsideration of  
approaches that promise appropriate technologies or user-centered design  
as science that imply technology designers must develop objects appropri-  
ate to some stable, coherent, and knowable cultural space. Such models of  
cultural difference figure two locations, ‘‘here’’ and ‘‘there,’’ where ‘‘there’’  
is other, apart, and disconnected, stably distanced from ‘‘here.’’ ‘‘There,’’  
the site of intervention must be knowable so that design interventions can  
be correct or effective. This spatialization of here and there is itself a legacy  
of colonial systems of difference, where the colonial power observes from a  
vantage point ahead of, or above, the colonized populations. We suggest  
that the design of objects is inextricable from a conversation about how  
these places are related to one another both by their uneven relations of  
power and the very presence of the observer marking the difference.  
An alternative to Appropriate Technology (AT) practice can be found in  
a recent movement known as Critical Technical Practice (CTP; Agre 1997).  
Beginning through attempts to diagnose the limits of dominant AI para-  
digms, CTP coupled technical exercises with Derridean critical theory. CTP  
has been taken up in HCI as well as new media arts as a way of questioning  
assumptions of computational systems and motivating alternative technol-  
ogies. As design theorist Warren Sack reminds us, ‘‘Even the technical  
details of the new media mechanisms we are discussing today are political.  
It’s politics all the down’’ (Sengers 2009).  
CTP suggests, then, that there is no escape from the political nature of  
technocultural practice. Instead, there are only located, always ambivalent  
engagements. This approach is one alternative to the sort of practice that  
claims correct answers, appropriate technologies, and user-centeredness for  
knowable sites of intervention. Instead of good conscience design interven-  
tions, CTP generates reflective and provocative engagements and more  
questions. Artist Simon Penny suggests that CTP catalyses expansive  
inventive thinking, and that ‘‘this approach tacitly recognizes that certain  
types of artistic problem solving compensate for the ‘tunnel vision’ charac-  
teristic of certain types of scientific and technical practice’’ (Penny 2000). If  
technical practices—whether robotics or jugaad—are enacted politically all  
the way down, then symmetry offers a tactic for analysis of the ‘‘modern’’  
and ‘‘indigenous’’ alike. 
Tactic 4: When technoscientific knowledge appears to diffuse from  
higher to lower concentrations, we look for signs of the opposite.  
What forms of technical practice seem to move against the flow, to  
develop unexpectedly, to pool in alternative spaces? What else (peo-  
ple, technological objects, laws, and capital?) moves with, or against,  
these knowledge practices?
The Warumungu people of Australia have been developing the Mukurtu  
Wumpurrarni-kari Archive (MWA), a repository organized into categories  
negotiated as significant to Warmungu people. The archive is built around  
Warumungu practices that organize appropriate seeing and speaking  
through kinship networks. Depending on one’s kin, one is enabled to speak  
of and visit certain things but ought to avert their eyes around other things  
(Christen 2005). The system developed through negotiations and technolo-  
gical efforts among some Warumungu people, Christen, and software  
developers. The system now comes out of the stabilization of understand-  
ings of Warumungu information practice within an archival technology.  
If the indigenous spaces are sites of contestation, cultural innovation, and  
connection just as those spaces called modern, we should expect to find new  
forms of technical practices emerging and moving from these spaces.  
The archive is a tactic with a long history. In part, the MWA is a way of  
enabling storytelling for the education of younger generations who are  
now educated in town schools away from kin geographies. 11 The archive  
is also worldly; it has been designed by people conscious of and willing  
to circulate representations of aboriginal life as a way of engendering public  
awareness, interest, and alliances. ‘‘Culture’’ can be a product that sells cof-  
fee table books and gets grants. ‘‘Culture’’ is also a term through which  
Warumungu negotiate sovereignty and legitimacy with the Australian state  
(Christen 2005; Povinelli 2006). These indigenous information and technol-  
ogy practices call our attention to the politics of debates about legitimate  
use and access of information. Items in the MWA are neither public nor pri-  
vate but appropriate to see based on kin lines. This calls into question the  
public/private dichotomies that characterize many debates about intellec-  
tual property and digital commons. The MWA assigns ownership neither  
to a collective commons nor private individuals but instead grants access  
and use along negotiable lines of kinship.  
The dynamics of movement are critical to understanding contemporary  
problems of ICT and globalization. The archive’s technological reconfigura-  
tions underscore how contact, mobility, and circulation—worldliness—is as  
much a part of so-called indigenous technologies as it is of modern ones. Historian David Arnold (2005) has argued that prevalent conceptions of  
technology diffusing from the West to the rest of the world have covered over  
the many innovative scientific, agricultural, and medical technologies that  
traveled to Europe and America from the supposed periphery. How do peo-  
ple, ideas, technologies, and methods move between different domains, and  
what sorts of problems attend those translations? How are these new techno-  
logical mobilities situated within transnational migrations of people, capital,  
and other resources? How does history become consequential in contempo-  
rary technology use and meaning? What kinds of policy, infrastructures, and  
methods might support the development of new forms of partnership, and  
what kinds of transformations might we imagine and expect in commercial  
and technological practice as such transnational connections proliferate?  
These alternative practices are not innocent, but worldly. We do not sug-  
gest, then, looking to these alternative practices as a nobler way of living or  
as inspiration for better solutions to be redistributed globally. ‘‘It worked for  
us, so let us transform it to work for them’’ is as problematic as ‘‘it worked  
for them, so let us transform it to work for us.’’ As we have argued, the post-  
colonial computing calls the terms ‘‘work,’’ ‘‘us,’’ and ‘‘them’’ into ques-  
tion, while calling for reimagined, accountable, and provisional forms of  
transformation.
Tactic 5: The universal model, the view from everywhere, and the voice  
of the center remain radically incomplete. But they cannot be com-  
pleted by addition. Context and particulars are always already consti-  
tutive of a sociotechnical model, and therefore we begin with them,  
rather than adding them as ‘‘complex’’ supplements to a ‘‘simple’’  
initial model.
Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) is a Web site where employers can put up  
large volumes of small tasks for pennies a task. People seeking to kill time  
or earn money can come to the site to perform the work. The many thou-  
sands of workers provide an around-the-clock workforce that provides  
«artificial artificial intelligence» to software developers. Cognitive piece-  
workers label images, structure data, and rewrite sentences within form  
fields that make their output amenable to searching, filtering, and display  
on Web sites such as Amazon.com. Computation, here, is not only what  
happens in silicon and circuit boards but also in other wetware and flesh-  
ware brought into alignment in service of computation. The computational  
laborers are legally considered contractors in Amazon’s Terms and Condi-  
tions and thus not entitled to minimum wage, though most workers make a few dollars an hour. In high-tech media, the low wages are explained as  
sensible because many people report doing it for fun and those who do not  
are presumed to live in a poorer country. However, one of the few surveys  
of workers found that 15 percent of workers always or sometimes rely on  
AMT to make basic ends meet and a larger proportion of such workers are  
in the United States (Ross et al. 2010).  
Human labor is part of the processor power of computational networks.  
Who assembles materials so that chips can compute? These are not new  
questions nor do we invoke them here in order to assert the computer’s  
materiality in the last instance. We wish to ask, instead, questions about the  
status, scope, and significance of the problem of materiality.  
At one level, all computing is literally material; the representational and  
computational efficacy of the informational revolution is built on the prac-  
tices of twentieth-century materials science and engineering. One cannot  
pose the question of matter without opening up a familiar political debate.  
When does the materiality of the computer emerge—in the conceptual  
advances in circuit design? In the assembly of ever-smaller circuits?  
In 1985, The Cyborg Manifesto invoked the ‘‘nimble fingers of ‘Orien-  
tal’ women’’ and ‘‘women’s enforced attention to the small,’’ taking the  
postindustrial scientific revolution to task. Haraway (1985) predicted, ‘‘it  
might be the unnatural cyborg women making chips in Asia and spiral dan-  
cing in Santa Rita jail whose constructed unities will guide effective oppo-  
sitional strategies’’ (p. 154). What do we know, a quarter-century after the  
Cyborg Manifesto, about the conditions of informatic production? We  
know of the toxics used in chip manufacture and some of their health effects  
on workers.12 We know that in 1995, a 55-pound computer ‘‘generated 139  
pounds of waste and used 7300 gallons of water and 2300 kilowatt-hours of  
energy, and will use many times that energy during its lifetime, will fill  
landfills with toxic waste after its lifetime’’ (Ryan and Durning 1997). Early  
twenty-first-century computer advertising comes with claims of green  
design and manufacture, which indicates the decrease of resource use and  
waste, but with no anticipation of a complete remediation of the problem.  
And green concerns have become safely detached from red ones—that is,  
ecological footprint stories and green design claims invariably appear sepa-  
rately from reporting on political economic footprints. Some forms of STS  
avoid the narratives of capital and the polemics of sustainability, in favor  
of the complexity of description.13 It might seem to some of us that the prob-  
lems of exploitation are now passe ́, obsolete. After all, has not labor been vir-  
tualized? Is not information clean, free of the soot of industrial era dirt? Has  
not the rise of knowledge work displaced the concerns about manual work? From one perspective, computing and global markets conjure visions of  
clean development. From another, they evoke new inequities in a networked  
global division of labor. Postcolonial Computing offers a way of seeing  
from both perspectives, but in ways that destabilize each. Rather than add-  
ing one to the other as supplements, we begin by thinking both together.  
Politics and materiality function not as external context but as part of the  
ground for forging new modes of engaged description.
#### Postcolonial Computing in Action
As Lucy Suchman has argued, all forms of communications technologies  
impose regimes of action (Suchman 2007). Following her insight that  
‘‘technology is not the design of physical things. It is the design of practices  
and possibilities,’’ we see tactical Postcolonial Computing as an accessory  
to future practice not a nostalgic/guilty guide to colonial pasts.  
Information and Communication Technology for Development is one con-  
text of postcolonial computational practice—a space of hoping, planning,  
intervening, and designing. ICT4D practitioners have encountered the cultural  
specificities of technological practices firsthand. Many well-intentioned efforts  
to ‘‘migrate’’ technologies from developed contexts to other nations or parts of  
the world have foundered on infrastructural differences (e.g., Verrips and  
Meyer 2001; Akrich 1992) or on flawed social, cultural, political, or economic  
assumptions. In the 1970s and 1980s, the problems and failings of technology  
transfer gave rise to the ‘‘Appropriate Technology’’ (AT) movement that  
argued for taking smaller engineering interventions that take local needs more  
centrally into account (Smith 2005). AT left an intellectual legacy in the rec-  
ognition that user needs and contexts are of central importance and must be the  
place to start. This appreciation for local contexts has been expressed primarily  
as a focus on understanding the nature of the difference between ‘‘here’’ and  
‘‘there,’’ where ‘‘there’’ is the developing world, poor communities, or partic-  
ular countries understood as separate from the point of observation.  
This legacy has shaped recent ICT4D efforts, which often rely on taxo-  
nomic models of culture and teleological models of development, imagin-  
ing ‘‘developed’’ nations as the modern terminus. Such models have come  
under critique in the last two decades (e.g., in Development Studies, Polit-  
ical Economy, and Postcolonial Studies) and circulated within the ICT4D  
community. Mark Warschauer notes that ‘‘well-intentioned programs often  
lead in unexpected directions, and the worst failures occur when people  
attempt to address complex social problems with a narrow focus on provi-  
sion of equipment’’ (Warschauer 2003, 43). ‘Global technology design’’ manifests another postcolonial computing  
site. As technology companies identify attractive markets in ‘‘emerging  
economies,’’ technology designers try to understand and design for contexts  
unfamiliar to Euro-American design practice. In HCI and information sys-  
tems practice, user-centered approaches involve an active engagement with  
users or their direct representatives through a variety of methods and staged  
encounters. As technology companies design for these different spaces, the  
methods and practices of technology design travel.  
‘‘Global design,’’ however, seems unreliable—systems effective in the  
United States may fail utterly in Japan, and design aesthetics vary wildly  
from place to place (Marcus and Gould 2000). Even methods for partici-  
patory design and usability evaluation—genres of social practice with a  
history of reliability in Western design contexts—fail in new cultural con-  
texts (Akrich 1992). Designers and marketers have taken up taxonomic  
models of culture to explain and design for difference. Such categories  
may suit particular agendas and projects (Goh 2006), can serve to ‘‘sort  
people out,’’ or to strategically argue difference to one’s own advantage  
(Mazzarella 2003).  
Global distributions of computational labor, implicated in the knowl-  
edge economy, are a third postcolonial situation. Postcolonial geogra-  
phies of interconnectivity, collaboration, labor, trade, and extraction  
have been enabled in part by the distributed connectivity and storage of  
the Internet (Aneesh 2006), the metrological practices of technoscience  
(Latour 1987; Turnbull 2000), and new systems of financial regulation  
(Ferguson 2006). While outsourcing has gained some visibility in  
Euro-American media, computer manufacturing is an often-hidden site  
in the social life of computing.  
We see Postcolonial Studies and Postcolonial STS as offering long-term,  
flexible, and robust accounts of cross-cultural engagement and history—  
accounts that elucidate these longstanding, thorny problems in ICT, but also  
promise to enrich STS and HCI. Several STS scholars have recently elabo-  
rated aspects of engineering and design (Fortun 2004; Latour 2008) as  
embodying central aspects of STS concerns. In the spirit of this discussion,  
we have drawn from STS and postcolonial studies a set of issues relevant to  
information technology.  
Rather than seeking to ‘‘reform’’ design, we call into question the separa-  
tion of standard and fringe or mainstream and marginal notions of design.  
Marginal, frontier-like, or ‘‘culturally sensitive’’ participatory ‘‘fringes’’  
of design have much to tell us about mainstream computing. Enlightenment  
science and reason, similarly, are not a disconnected, binary opposite to non-Western cultural practices. Such binaries were perhaps always fantasies  
of structuralist and culturalist simplification, and certainly cannot hold now,  
with the consequences of international traffic in design discourses, technolo-  
gies, and people. It is in this sense that Postcolonial Computing is simultane-  
ously the name of a phenomenon and an articulation of both its hegemonic  
and its resistant practices.  
Postcolonial Computing proposes a rubric under which to examine this  
new global configuration of technology, cultural practices, economic rela-  
tions, and narratives of development. This analytical rubric is interdisciplin-  
ary from the ground up, exploring how cultural contexts shape the design  
and use of ICT, as well as how ICT and ICT design function as a site of cul-  
tural encounter and technological translation.
#### Conclusion
Postcolonial computing is a way of asking questions, a mode of investi-  
gating and a form of conversation. It is not a theory of ends—it does not  
imply the historical end of colonialism, the end of exploitation, the end of  
history, nor is it a road map to egalitarianism, communitarianism, or  
democracy as philosophical ends. Postcolonial Computing is an approach  
to familiar areas of research that could too easily slip into simple,  
rigid patterns, achieving closure and canonicity at the expense of discov-  
ery and experimentation. It is more mode than method; more tactic  
than strategy; more a way of proceeding than a field object. It is a tactical  
epistemology, a need-to-know approach to reality that expands the  
scope of what one needs to know, and improves returns on our transdis-  
ciplinary reach.  
Each tactic incorporates a vignette drawn from our larger research  
projects. Rather than tell each of those stories, we have used them  
anecdotally to demonstrate how particular modes of problematization  
draw questions out of our seemingly banal, daily observations in the  
field. We call our results tactics, rather than methodologies, strategies,  
or universal guarantors of truth. Tactics lead not to the true or final design  
solution but to the contingent and collaborative construction of other nar-  
ratives. These other narratives remain partial and approximate, but they  
are irrevocably opened up to problematization. Such instability might ear-  
lier have been viewed as a problem (stability implying lack of truth, con-  
tingency showing lack of universality), but perhaps we can recognize,  
now, how instability can be a strength, not a weakness, of technoscientific  
practice and theory.
