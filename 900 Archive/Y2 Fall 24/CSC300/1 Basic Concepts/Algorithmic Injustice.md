# Algorithmic Injustice: A Relational Ethics Approach

See [[Week 2 - Ethical Reasoning and its Relevance to Computer and Society]].

## Introduction

- Algorithmic decision-making permeates the social sphere:
    - Applications: Allocating medical care, predicting crimes, selecting welfare beneficiaries, and hiring.
    - Challenges: Fails to grasp complex social issues, providing false solutions and safety.

- **Key Issues**:
    - Social problems require historical, political, and moral awareness.
    - Data scientists making decisions in social contexts must consider ethics beyond technical tasks.

- **Automation and Ethics**:
    - Socially contested matters reduced to technical problems.
    - The veneer of objectivity in algorithms hides intrinsic value judgments.
    - Ethical challenges stem from historical inequalities, unexamined assumptions, and power asymmetries.

- **Relational Ethics**:
    - Calls for centering the experiences of marginalized communities.
    - Advocates for improved material conditions over abstract ethical ideals.

## Relational Ethics: The Roots

- **Relationality vs. Rationality**:
    - Rationality prioritizes reason, objectivity, and static knowledge.
    - Relationality emphasizes context, interdependence, and lived experience.

- **Philosophical Background**:
    - Rationality traced to thinkers like Plato, Descartes, and Newton.
    - Rational worldview:
        - Values certainty and abstraction over dynamic relations.
        - Ignores historical and cultural influences.

- **Relational Frameworks**:
    - Examples: Ubuntu, Black feminist epistemologies, and complexity science.
    - Shared principles: Interdependence, relationships, and context.

## Rationality: The Dominant Orthodoxy

- **Core Characteristics**:
    - Abstract, contextless reasoning.
    - Separation of thought from emotion, culture, and ethics.
    - Rationality treated as the “standard” for knowledge.

- **Historical Roots**:
  - Cartesianism:
    - Descartes prioritized reason over senses and emotions.
    - Established static, universal knowledge ideals.
  - Newtonian Science:
    - Mechanistic worldview prioritizing predictability and order.

- **Critiques**:
    - Rationalism inadequately addresses complex, adaptive systems.
    - Reinforces binary thinking and harmful biases in data science.
    - Positions Western, straight, white male perspective as “universal.”

## Relationality: A Counter Perspective

- **Principles**:
    - Existence as co-dependent in a web of relations.
    - Selfhood and knowledge evolve through interactions.

- **Examples**:
    - **Ubuntu**: “I am because we are.”
    - **Bakhtinian Dialogism**: Knowledge emerges through encounters with others.
    - **Afro-Feminist Epistemology**:
        - Lived experience as the basis of reliable knowledge.
        - Knowledge claims grounded in community and wisdom.

- **Implications for Ethics**:
    - Prioritizes the perspectives of marginalized communities.
    - Challenges “neutral” data practices that strip context and perpetuate harm.

## Applications to Data Practices

- **Challenges in Current Approaches**:
    - Data often treated as neutral representations of reality.
    - Context is stripped away during data collection and cleaning.
    - Researchers’ biases and motivations remain invisible.

- **Relational Perspective**:
    - Advocates for considering “data settings” instead of decontextualized datasets.
    - Emphasizes ethical responsibility to mitigate algorithmic harm.
