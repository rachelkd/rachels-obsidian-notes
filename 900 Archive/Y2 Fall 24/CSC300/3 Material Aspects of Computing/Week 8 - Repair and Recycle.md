# Rethinking Repair: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Broken World Thinking</mark>

- When you approach the point of **breakdown** when discussing the nature, use, and effects of information technology and new media
- If you only talk about how great a technology is and how it can solve your problems, you are not telling the whole picture
    - True that new things are happening/being built
    - But things are also breaking down pretty quickly
        - e.g., Old infrastructure (landlines, buildings in neighbourhoods)
    - The way you use older technologies is by fixing and repairing

> [!info]+ Two parts to **Broken World Thinking**
>
> - Appreciation that ==natural, social, technological worlds are limited and fragile== and ==many stories/orders of modernity are coming apart==
>     - *Breakdown*, *dissolution*, and *change* are key themes and problems rather than innovation, development, and design
> - Appreciate for ==ongoing activities by which stability is maintained==
>     - *Repair* and *restoration* of socio-technical forms and infrastructures

- Rethink repair as a site of care and collaboration
- Repair work is often rendered *invisible*
    - Is articulation work that involves breakdown, maintenance, restoration that underlie bigger stories e.g., exploration, empire, and globalization
- The world is always breaking
    - This process is **generative**, **productive**, and **consequential**

<!-- break -->
- **Implications for Innovation**
    - Often highly valued in development while repair is ignored
    - Though often innovation is *dependent* on breakdown
- **Implications for Knowledge and Power**
    - Broken world thinking draws attention to the ==sociality of objects== forward in ongoing forms of labour, power, and interest that allow things to survive as objects in the world
    - e.g., When your car breaks, you look for a person with knowledge in cars to fix
    - Technology is political!
    - When things break apart, we understand how powerful a piece of technology is
- **Implications for Ethics**
    - An ethics of care underpinning relations between other ethical actors shaped by ethical responsibility in mutual dependency and entanglement
        - Care brings the worlds of action and meaning together
    - Could bring care into the world of technology — that often lacks this moral slant — through repair in the style of craft traditions
    - v.s. When you discard technologies, you do not think about its impact on environment and other people

## Case Study: Care in Repair: The Caring Hand

- Bangharis
    - E-waste recyclers in Bangladesh
    - Use knowledge, skills, collaboration, and especially *care* to refurbish or repurpose e-waste
    - Hand is the device that bangharis uses to sense, test, and assess the worth of a device
- **Care** is embodied in the hand in two ways:
    - Making sure important devices/components do not break further
    - Make sure they do not hurt themselves while interacting with broken objects
- While the hand *extends care*, it also *endures pains* due to bangharis working in unprotected work environments with hazardous materials

# Disposal: E-Waste

- When electronics break down, they are disposed of
- Often, discarded electronics from Global North end up in the Global South
- E-waste can be viewed from three perspectives:
    - **Social and environmental justice**
        - e.g., “Why are electronics from the Global North going to the Global South?”
    - **Environmental toxicology and occupational health**
        - The people in the Global South dealing with e-waste are not working in a healthy situation, do not have knowledge of how to dispose in a safer way
    - **Material energy flows in electronics production** and **ways to manage the disposal of post-consumption electronics**
        - A lot of materials are used to build electronics
        - Global South now has this problem of e-waste
        - But can find lots of materials in waste to be repurposed
        - With proper knowledge, skills, engineering, they can take over since they have more materials than any Western countries

## Social/Environmental Justice

- Environmental injustice occurs in a form of **toxic colonialism** when hazardous waste is exported to developing countries
    - Countries like the US and Canada consider these countries pollutable and perpetuate colonial processes that prioritize certain lives
    - You don’t throw it out in the West, because you know these materials are harmful to health → Throw it out in Global South because you care less about the health of the people there
    - Similar mindset that colonists have

## Environmental Toxicology and Occupational Health

- In the disassembly of e-waste in disposal facilities, toxic compounds spread to the environment, affecting the health of individuals in the facility and local area
    - Do not have access to use PPE
- e.g., High levels of brominated flame retardants in dust and air in the e-waste recycling and nearby urban areas in South China and Thailand
    - BFRs accumulation in people associated with endocrine, reproductive, and behavioural effects
- e.g., Silicone wristbands and fabric of t-shirts can be used to measure exposure to flame retardants
    - High levels found amongst e-waste disposal workers in Bangladesh
    - Workers wear t-shirts that are returned at the end of the day → Shipped to labs for toxicology evaluation

## Material Energy Flows

- We can ==rethink waste and value in a relational way==
    - Discuss e-waste as material that can undergo *value creation/transformation*
    - Go from waste → product → enter reuse market
- ==Dirt, disposal, and waste are material categories==
    - Indicative of social ordering practices rather than an essential end point in an economic chain
    - Contingencies of practices bring things into and out of rubbish value
    - Whether something is waste or not depends on who you are, how you see things, etc.

> [!important]+ While value is often understood as a proportion of final price along a value chain/production network, this does not account for **post-consumption value creation** (resale, refurbishment, remanufacturing, repair, dismantling, etc.)
>
> - More than 200k people are involved in the rubbish recovery economy in Bangladesh
> - → Bring rubbish value material back into production
> - Typical value chains and processing networks do not account for this

- Value is also created in **post-disposal**
    - Importation from other countries in Asia account for the large proportion of e-waste volume in Bangladesh
        - Components and materials are returned in and for production in the South
            - e.g., Refurbished monitors sold locally and shipped to Afghanistan, China, and Somalia
        - E-waste materials also enter production in the South for the North
- Flow can occur across sectors
    - E-waste in Bangladesh → Toys/jewellery for the North

# Building on Broken World Thinking: Repair Worlds

- Focussing on the repair worlds in the Kavango region of Northeastern Namibia and making this the *locus* for opportunity ==allowed for the discovery of implications for policy and design==
    - Need for better bridges with formal development projects and local repair worlds
        - Otherwise, double loss
    - Challenge separation of IT and IT policy
    - Challenge the idea of innovation only at the point of creation

# Right to Repair

- Copyright laws are now being used to copyright software/technologies
- Tech companies are increasingly using copyright law to target third party tech repair companies
    - e.g., Void warranties, punish people for wanting to repair their products
- People are challenging these copyrights for reasons of transparency (and cybersecurity)
    - Also to enable the consumer to affordably/fairly repair their device
- If you legally own something, you should be able to access/repair your technology

## Right to Repair Statistics

- To make products last longer and save some money
- 53% have replaced broken products
- 83% say repairing is important for vehicles
- 60% say repairing is important for larger appliances

# Understanding Breakdown → Repair Socially

- A dominant culture of *consumerism* means that there is often *stigma* surrounding repairing what is broken
    - vs. buying something new
- Often forgotten that repair is skilled work and involves creativity/innovation
- Repair work supports numerous institutions/devices/communities, often ==invisibly==
- Modes of resistance:
    - **Individual**
    - **Community**
    - **Cultural**

## Individual

- Developing a *relationship* and engaging with these tools in a meaningful way can ==incentivize repair rather than throwing it away for something new==
    - Relationship not tied/dependent to objects in the ways of consumerism
    - Instead, a deep appreciation for the way it assists you/might enhance your life and recognizing the effort put into/lifecycle of the object
- e.g., **Post-Humanism Approach:** *Digital Being: Scale*, 2014 ([here](https://vimeo.com/89527147))
    - ‘Scale’ hacks, repairs, and reassembles a series of broken and discarded technologies to produce new interactive combinations that call out the forms of value, obduracy, and creative possibility to be found in the object worlds around us
    - It also invites reflection on contemporary experiences of technology use and obsolescence more generally

## Community

- ==City of Dead== in Egypt
    - Originally cemeteries/mausoleums
    - Now home to a community
    - **Metaphoric** approach
        - What once was home to the dead is now home to many who are living
        - Residents here face *stigma* over making their home amongst cemeteries
- ==Need to think about repurposing something for something else to *serve* more people==

## Cultural

- Understanding objects as having greater value with having been fixed
    - Objects are *imbued* (inspired) with history and meaning
    - Process of tending to and repairing the object imparts more meaning upon them
- e.g., “==Kintsugi==” (golden joinery)
    - Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/dXonoCi.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZpbuYen.png)
- e.g., “==Jugaad==”
    - A way of approaching repair and extending the life of objects through innovation
    - A way to fix problems and discover solutions using seemingly incongruous objects and technologies in an out-of-the-box manner
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/gfabFmC.png)
        - *Using a car engine to run a machine to extract sugarcane juice.*
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/q7nyWbE.png)
        - *Using a car jumper to charge electronic phones.*

# Conclusion: Point of Analysis

- Technology materials can be analyzed at various stages:
    - **Point of extraction**
        - Raw materials
    - **Point of repair**
        - Rethinking innovation
        - Care located at the site of the hand as with Bangladeshi e-waste recyclers
    - **Point of disposal**
        - Subsequent value creation by *refurbishing* the technology
        - Environmental/health concerns
        - Social justice concerns
            - e.g., Skilled craft-based work, but lacking the equipment, additional training, safety precautions necessary to further develop their skills and protect the workers
