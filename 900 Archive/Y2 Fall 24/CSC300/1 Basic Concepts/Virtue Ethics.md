Perhaps being moral is more about *good habits* of character vs. actions and consequences.

> [!def]- Virtue ethics
> - Normative theory that emphasizes the *virtues* or the *moral character* of an individual

- Less emphasis on learning rules
- More importance of ==developing good habits and character==
- Oldest types of normative ethics with roots in Ancient Greece

# Virtue Ethics: Plato, Aristotle, and the Greeks

## Golden Mean

- The mean = middle point
- Aristotle:
    - Virtue is the *balance* between two behavioural extremes
- Virtue is in ==moderation==: never in excess, never too little
    - i.e., ==the ideal between excess and deficiency==

## Application: the virtue of Courage

According to Aristotle, courage is a virtue that is the *mean* between aggression (excess) and cowardice (deficiency).

> [!question] What is the right amount of courage?

- According to virtue ethics, someone is courageous if they:
    - Endures and fears the *right things*,
        - Does not have irrational fears (e.g., black cats)
    - Has fears for the *right reason*,
        - Isn’t fearful because of superstition
    - Shows courage with the *right motive*,
        - Demonstrates courage for the good of others; not selfish reasons
    - Shows courage in the *right manner*,
        - Doesn’t make a big deal of themselves or draw attention
    - Shows courage and at the *right time*
        - Knows how to pick battles
- What are the right things, reasons, motives, manners, and times?
    - Greek philosophers did not answer this question directly case-by-case
    - If someone does something and they are virtuous, they should be able to explain to others *why* they behaved a way in a particular context

## Example: Failing to Apply virtue Ethics

Consider kindness.
- Not all “acts of kindness” are *truly* kind according to virtue ethics
- Failing to be kind:
    - Wrong *thing*
        - e.g., being kind towards a thief
    - Wrong *reason*
        - e.g., being kind out of guilt
    - Wrong *motive*
        - e.g., to gain advantage (like giving a gift for a favour)
    - Wrong *way*
        - e.g., kindness is not sensitive to the needs of the person you are being kind to
    - Wrong *time*
        - e.g., being kind in order to distract from suffering you plan to inflict
- If someone is virtuous, then they would have a good reason to explain why they were kind to that person
    - Explanation should involve all these questions

> [!info] Virtue ethics is more interested in character, than individual events

# Can Virtues Conflict?

Example: your friend has broken the law. You know her whereabouts. The police knock on your door.

- What would a virtuous person do?
    - Loyalty: Misdirect the police
    - Truthfulness: Good civilian would lead police to friend

> [!warning] Objection to virtue ethics: offers no way to determine action in cases of virtue conflict

- Then, we look at [[Utilitarianism]] and [[Deontological Ethics]].
- Both deal with *how* to make decisions (ethical *reasoning*)

# Divine Command Theory; a Form of virtue Ethics

- What is the main argument for **Divine Command Theory**
    - ==Morality is determined by God’s commands==
- To be moral,
    - should act in a way commanded by God
- In cases of conflict, people might look to Divine Command Theory to make decisions
    - Prioritize virtues accordingly to God’s words
- Can also be postulated as a **social command theory**:
    - To be moral is to ==follow society’s commands==
    - e.g., political systems (socialism, capitalism, communism)
        - What is a virtuous person in light of capitalism, or Christianity, or Islam?
        - If your friend is losing money, you can say that’s not good; you should invest money here
    - In another society, people might have a different understanding of what is good and bad
- When groups of people come into conflict, each convinced that they are acting in alignment with the will of God, what then?
    - e.g., crusade, terrorism, resistance, freedom fighting?
    - ==Must reject== as a framework for ethically evaluating scenarios in a pluralistic society
        - In a multicultural society, very difficult to make virtue ethics as a societal ethical standard
        - Cannot impose that as a societal law; another person will not find the same as the right kind of virtue
    - Personal affairs: entirely up to individual
