# Realism

> [!question]- What do realists believe?
> - There are objective good and bad features to the world, which these propositions are about
>     - i.e., There are specific good and bad rules that apply to everyone no matter what
> - Moral realists may also believe morality and objective rules are handed down to by a deity
>     - e.g., Judeo-Christian God

Realism can be said to be:
1. **Ethical naturalists**, or
2. **Ethical non-naturalists**

## Ethical Naturalism

- Ethical claims can be expressed as *natural properties without the use of ethical terms*
- e.g., something like “bad” can be reduced to some natural property:
    - “bad” → pain
        - Study how pain is inflicted on a person → investigating the moral concept of “badness”
    - “good” → well-being
- Ethical naturalist, neuroscientist ==Sam Harris==:
    - Inflicting intense suffering on anything conscious is objectively morally wrong
    - Analogy of hot stove:
        - Touching the stove will be undeniably painful
        - Something everyone can agree on
        - Can be used to form the basis of good and bad
        - Badness $\implies$ Suffering of conscious creators

### “Is-ought” Problem

- Problem about ethical naturalism from philosopher ==David Hune==
- People take how things are or empirical facts about the world, and use them to derive moral conclusions illogically
- People move too readily from observations of facts to moral judgements
- Shouldn’t be any connection between empirical facts and values

## Ethical Non-naturalism

- There are objective and irreducible moral properties
    - e.g., property of “goodness”
- Philosopher ==G.E. Moore==:
    - We know things like “good” and “bad” just by seeing them
    - Like we know the colour blue by intuition
    - Of course, if it were that easy and true, there would not be so many moral disagreements
