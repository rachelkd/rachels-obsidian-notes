# Do **artifacts** Have Politics?

- Artifacts:
    - Usually think of artifacts as *cultural* artifacts; what archaeologists dig up and put in museums
    - *Technological* artifact is more resonant:
        - e.g., Smartphone
            - Similar to pottery that people dig up: was probably cutting-edge tech during its time
    - All artifacts tell us about people who build and use them
        - We want to learn something about the societies that existed by looking at their technology/artifacts

# How Does Technology Shape Our Society?

- Underpasses on Southern State Parkway, Long Island, NY
    - Designed by ==Robert Moses==
        - Famous city planner
        - Arguably created the concept of suburbs
        - Also widely considered a classist and racist
    - Built underpasses 20” shorter than other underpasses in the city
    - Did not want public transportation (i.e., busses) to access the new beach he built
    - Who used public transportation at that time?
        - People Moses did not want mingling on his park
        - Minorities, immigrants, poor people used public transportation

> [!important] Technology enforces the politics of the people who build them

- e.g., We think that any citizen of D.C. should be able to access any part of the city at any time using public transit
    - A moral question; question of ethics
    - Maybe they would find a way to build a metro station there
    - Any cost would be easy to overcome if people were really dedicated to that belief
    - People don’t often think like this
- People are often very willing to do a lot of inconveniences for technological progress
    - Much less willing to make any kind of accommodation for social progress
    - This should change
- Whenever anyone (e.g., developer or user) introduces a new technology into our lives, we need to ask:
    - Do artifacts have politics? Always, yes
    - Are the politics of this technology our own politics?
        - Politics of any particular tech are often different from personal politics
    - What is my responsibility to restore the balance that this technology has disrupted?
        - Not to say that we should not use technology
        - We get good benefits from technology!
- If we all decide to make some small changes, then maybe we can try to *restore* the human connections that technology has broken
    - e.g., Social media keeps you in your echo chamber:
        - Maybe go out and have a real conversation with someone you disagree with
