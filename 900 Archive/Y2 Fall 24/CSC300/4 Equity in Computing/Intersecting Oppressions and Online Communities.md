### Examining the experiences of women of color in Xbox Live
Employing qualitative methods and drawing from an intersectional framework which  
focusses on the multiple identities we all embody, this paper focusses on oppressions  
experienced by women of color in Xbox Live, an online gaming community.  
Ethnographic observations and narrative interviewing reveal that women of color,  
as outsiders failing to conform to the white male norm, face intersecting oppressions  
in main stream gaming. They are linguistically profiled within the space based on  
how they sound. Specifically, Latina women within the space experience nativism,  
racism, sexism, and even heterosexism as many identify as sexual minorities.  
African-American women experience racialized sexism stemming from the duality  
of their ascribed identities. The women within the study have responded by segregat-  
ing from the larger gaming community and have created their own clans (similar to  
guilds) and game with other women. The purpose of the clans depends on the type of  
oppressions experienced by the women within the space. This article analyzes this  
behavior in the context of linguistic profiling showcasing that this type of behavior  
can only occur within the setting of anonymity and disinhibition. With the diffusion  
of advanced technologies in video gaming, there has been a displacement of real  
world inequalities into virtuality
### Introduction
My journey begins the same as it always has, in the comfort of night with the  
sounds of light whirring and warmth emitting gently in my direction. It’s  
almost soothing, white noise to a baby’s ear. I continue along and enter the world of Sera. I’m not alone. There are others who have embarked on  
this journey with me. We group ourselves together so we don’t have to con-  
tinue as individuals and become a collective, a team. We are just a group of  
people gathered for one cause, to save the world.

We organize ourselves for safety and many begin to talk strategy. The  
number one goal: stay alive! Several in the group begin talking and it’s  
obvious one has emerged as our leader. I listen attentively and pay attention  
to the directions given. My first task, guard a particular area and prevent our  
foe from nabbing a certain weapon. My efforts were not successful. This led  
to the demise of my entire team, and I was disappointed I could not put up  
more of a fight to defeat the enemy. Fortunately for us, this magical world  
allows us to come back to life, giving us a chance to avenge our deaths.  
We begin in another location and once again I am given instructions to help  
serve the team. This time, I am tasked with the safety of the leader. So I follow  
him and provide support. He runs naively into the opponent and I follow him as a  
good teammate would. This heroic attempt was foolhardy as we are flanked and  
killed; I am blamed for this failure once again although our team emerges  
victorious.

The leader begins talking rather harshly to me and is upset that I am not  
engaging with the team or responding to his questions. So as to not aggravate  
him further, I insert my microphone and begin talking. I start off by apologizing  
for my failures and pledge to do better. However, this conversation shifts away  
from my poor performance within battle to attacks against me as a person.  
‘Oh you guys hear this? That’s why you suck. You’re a fucking girl! What the  
fuck are you doing in my room?’ Even after this initial attack, I am still apologetic  
hoping that the attacks will soon end (at this point, I am used to the name  
calling). However, the attacks get worse and other team members join in:

Wait wait wait. You’re not just any girl. You’re black. Get this black bitch off  
my team . . . Did you spend all your welfare check buying this game? . . . Get  
back to your crack pipe with your crack babies.

The insults continue with a barrage of colorful stereotypical comments aimed at  
me as an African-American woman. The beautiful world I begin discussing is  
not so beautiful all the time. The journey, although mostly fun and enjoyable,  
frequently becomes a place full of hatred and intolerance. This journey I am  
referring to is the online gaming experience associated with Xbox Live – a  
console video game (Gray 2011, pp. 1 – 2). Although this is one of the most  
extreme displays of racially sexist speech I experienced personally, other margin-  
alized gamers experience similar acts of racism, sexism, and other inequalities  
everyday inside these virtual walls.  
### Hegemony and identity in video games
Suler and Phillips (1998) place the blame of this type of deviant behavior on the  
infrastructure of many digital spaces. Specifically, chat communities are built  
upon certain types of software that allow for the interactive environment in  
which users can engage. However, those who misbehave essentially exploit the  
environment by utilizing sounds, visual imagery, and text abilities to harass  
others. In voice-based communities such as Xbox Live, there is no need to  
modify the infrastructure of the space to harass others (although the structure  
allows for it); all you have to do is speak, creating an environment that  
fosters linguistic profiling. Given that most digital technologies resemble real  
world spaces, it is easier for offline inequalities to manifest online; as Nakamura  
(2002) suggests, gender, class, and race hierarchies have been carried onto the  
internet. So even though a user may be able to leave the body behind when enter-  
ing cyberspace, the real body still lingers – creating a racialized or gendered  
cybertype, and our ‘fluid selves are no less subject to cultural hegemonies,  
rules of conduct and regulating cultural norms than are solid ones’ (Nakamura  
2002, p. 325). Kolko (2000) reinforces Nakamura’s argument where she  
suggests that there is an inherent desire to ignore race and ethnicity in virtual  
worlds. She notes that the default ethnicity on most Multi User Domains  
(MUD) is set to White creating a default whiteness for virtual worlds  
(p. 216), replicating real world spaces where unmarked whiteness is the cultural  
norm. Additionally, massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG)  
such as EverQuest II and World of Warcraft have actually seen the disappearance  
and omission of blackness from these kinds of virtual fantasy worlds.  
EverQuest, an MMORPG that features a Black race of playable characters,  
succeeded in incorporating Black bodies into game play. However, the Erudites,  
the Black race, were from a segregated continent that was smaller, less appealing,  
and far less populated than the White continent. When EverQuest II was released,  
the Erudite (Black) race had evolved into a ‘skeletal, Caucasoid’ that was ‘vaguely  
extraterrestrial’ (Higgin 2009, p. 14). This hegemonic change re-privileged  
whiteness, as the narrative deployed was the devaluing of one race over another.  
Kolko (2000) found it surprising that in a space that dramatized other aspects  
of identity such as gender and class, ethnicity was shockingly absent from most  
massively multiplayer online games (MMO). Debunking utopic assumptions of  
virtual space, Kolko argues that the internet is far from liberatory but rather a  
space that continues a ‘cultural map of assumed whiteness’ (p. 225). Kolko  
rightly points out that when there is an attempt to make race and ethnicity  
present, it is met with resistance. Additionally, as Higgin (2009) states:

The White dominance of gamespace has been recast as a racially progressive  
movement that ejects race in favor of a default, universal whiteness and has  
been ceded, in part, by a theoretical tendency to embrace passing and anonymity in cyberspace. When politically charged issues surface that  
reveal the embedded stereotypes at work amid an ostensibly colorblind  
environment, they are quickly de-raced and cataloged as aberrations  
rather than analyzed as symptomatic of more systemic trends. (pp. 7 –8)

As Leonard also found within discourses on Grand Theft Auto, there is a com-  
plete lack of interest in discussing racist content in these racialized games. Black-  
ness in MMORPG’s is intentionally ignored to avoid critical issues associated  
with the other. This hegemony of play, as Fron et al. (2007) term, perpetuates  
the exclusion of communities as is seen in the offline world, a manifestation of  
real world inequalities.
### Online disinhibition fuels virtual inequality
Deviance within virtual communities has been documented by scholars for years.  
For instance, Richard Bartle was one of the earliest scholars to provide a  
systematic overview of the killer, a type of user within a MUD. The killer  
derives enjoyment by imposing his/her self on others by player killing. As  
Bartle found, the more distress killers cause, the greater the killer’s joy  
(Bartle 1996). Since Bartle’s Taxonomy, others have expanded upon negative  
player interaction.  
Griefing is another form of deviance within virtual communities and has  
been defined as the intentional harassment of other players within the game  
(Foo & Koivisto 2004; Smith 2004; Lin & Sun 2005; Warner & Raiter 2005;  
Myers 2007). Griefers are players who derive their enjoyment not from  
playing the game but from causing other gamers to become distracted during  
game play (Foo & Koivisto 2004).  
Flaming is an additional form of player deviance and is similar to griefing. It  
refers to negative antisocial behaviors, including the expression of hostility, the  
use of profanity, and the venting of strong emotions (Thompsen 2003, p. 331).  
However, the only definition from the vast literature on flaming that comes  
close to what is experienced within Xbox Live comes from Dorwick who  
defines flaming as the spontaneous creation of homophobic, racist, and misogynist  
language during electronic communication (as cited in Thompsen 2003, p. 331).  
Suler and Phillips (1998) examine the overt presence of this type of speech in  
online spaces and found that anonymous spaces actually foster this type of environ-  
ment. Anonymity on the internet disinhibits people, compelling some to say and  
do things that they would not otherwise do. This disinhibition can work in two  
ways – benign and toxic. Users who display benign disinhibition show unusual  
acts of kindness and generosity (Suler 2004). On the other hand, toxic disinhibition  
occurs when users employ ‘rude language, harsh criticisms, anger, hatred, and  
even threats’ (Suler 2004, p. 321). There are six factors that interact to lead to online disinhibition: (1) dissociative anonymity; (2) invisibility; (3) asynchronicity;  
(4) solipsistic introjections; (5) dissociative imagination; and (6) minimization of  
status and authority. I will briefly discuss each one below.  
Dissociative anonymity refers to the ability to hide your identity in online  
spaces. Anonymity is a principle factor leading to the disinhibition effect  
because users can separate their online actions from their real world selves.  
Whatever they say and or do can not be linked to them in the real world.  
Some individuals may even justify their actions by convincing themselves that  
they are not connected to the online persona at all.  
Online environments also allow users the opportunity to be invisible as they  
move in and out of web sites, message boards, and sometimes chat rooms. This  
invisibility gives users the courage to say and do things they may not normally do.  
In some online spaces, your identity may be known but being ‘physically invisible  
amplifies the disinhibition effect’ (Suler 2004, p. 322).  
Asynchronicity is one factor that does not directly apply to the Xbox Live  
community. Asynchronicity implies that communication does not occur in real  
time in online spaces. This is sometimes true in email and message boards  
where it can take minutes, hours, days or months for a reply. As Suler (2004)  
explains, not having to deal with someone’s immediate reaction disinhibits  
people. However, one communication option in Xbox Live that most users  
employ is real time chat – synchronous communication; however, invisibility  
and anonymity still lead users to engage in toxic disinhibition.  
Solipsistic introjection implies that the lack of face to face cues or textual  
communication can ‘alter self-boundaries’ (Suler 2004, p. 323). What this  
means is that a user within an online space will create a character based on  
the online cues present within the online space. The person may create a  
visual image and create a voice of the other person oftentimes filling in blanks  
of the other person with false information or information from their own life.  
Essentially the other person becomes a player in your imagination or fantasy  
world. Suler (2004) suggests that cyberspace may become a stage where we  
are merely players in other people’s worlds.  
Dissociative imagination is the disconnect that occurs when we view the  
online world as a make-believe space. Some cyberspace users separate their  
online lives from their offline selves suggesting that their online life is a game  
where the rules do not apply to real life (Suler 2004):  
Once they turn off the computer and return to their daily routine, they  
believe they can leave behind that game and their game-identity. They relin-  
quish their responsible for what happens in a make-believe play world that  
has nothing to do with reality. (Suler 2004, p. 323)  
This occurs more easily in fantasy game environments where an imaginary char-  
acter is played by a user. Also this factor may not be as prevalent in a real-time voiced-based community such as Xbox Live. But without direct testing of these  
factors, this cannot be confirmed.  
The last factor, minimization of status and authority, reflects the reality of  
many online spaces – the absence of a suitable guardian supervising the space.  
As Suler (2004) explains, authority figures usually ‘express their status and  
power in their dress, body language, and in the trappings of their environmental  
settings’ (p. 324). The absence of the traditional cues reduces the impact of auth-  
ority in digital spaces. Even when authority figures are known to users, the lack  
of physical presence and cues diminishes their power within the space. This is  
true for Xbox Live. Authorities appear usually when a complaint is filed –  
and this does not occur at every instance. Suler (2004) further argues that  
people are disinhibited with the absence of an authority figure leading them to  
speak out and misbehave. By posing the question, does greater anonymity  
result in greater deviance, Suler and Phillips (1998) answer ‘yes’, suggesting  
that this increased anonymity allows a person to release their deviant side.
### Linguistic profiling
Because the Xbox Live space allows for real time, voice communication, much of  
the racism and sexism that emerge stem from linguistic profiling. Similar to racial  
profiling, linguistic profiling occurs when auditory cues as opposed to visual cues  
are used to confirm and/or speculate on the racial background of an individual  
(Baugh 2003). Scholars have long studied linguistic stereotypes, finding discrimi-  
nation based on accents and dialects against speakers of various ethnic back-  
grounds. What is seen in the American context is that voice discrimination  
and linguistic profiling used as effective means to filter out specific individuals.  
For instance, the executive director of the National Fair House Alliance noted  
that insurance companies, mortgage companies, and other financial institutions  
may refuse to extend services to you if you sound Black or Mexican. Now  
this discrimination is more subtle as they will not come out and say it to you  
directly, but rather they will not return your phone call or respond to written  
correspondence (Baugh 2003).  
Within the virtual world, Joinson (2001) suggests that the anonymous spaces  
of the internet compel users to disclose personal information about themselves  
knowing that the party on the other end will never find out the true identity.  
However, in virtual communities where voice can be heard, much of our per-  
sonal information is automatically emitted into virtuality. Voice-based commu-  
nities are unique from their text counterparts. Text-based communities rely  
on users to type information or upload textual information. In voice-based com-  
munities, certain information is revealed automatically when someone speaks. In  
the current study, the virtual community under investigation is a voice- and text-  
based community with many users employing the voice option to communicate. Although some users may have the ability to alter the voice, the console does not  
automatically come with this feature. So your real world voice can be heard. As  
many women and people of color explain, this mere technological advance  
creates the most havoc in their virtual lives – racism and sexism.  
In sum, virtual gaming spaces have been constructed as White, masculine  
power structures having hegemonic control with the ability to reproduce domi-  
nant ideology. Xbox Live is one such community that will be examined for its  
potential to deploy this ideology. While evidence of these oppressive structures  
has been established, Microsoft has yet to admit there is a problem within the  
space creating isolation for many marginalized bodies within the space. Given  
that, I am guided by the following research question:  
1. How significant is the voice in fostering linguistic profiling and creating an  
inequitable space for marginalized bodies?  
2. How have women of color as a marginalized population within this online  
gaming community responded to dominant narratives and social inequalities  
present within the space?  
I hypothesize that the women within this study experience multiple oppressions  
within this virtual gaming community based merely on how they sound and will  
respond in a manner that reflects resistance and survival tactics displayed by mar-  
ginalized women in the real world.
### Methodology
The current study employed commonly used ethnographic methods as outlined  
by Prus (1996): participant observations and narrative interviewing. Adhering to  
the principles of ethnography, my hope was to examine observable patterns of  
behavior, customs, and ways of life by immersing myself into the day-to-day  
activities of the community. Because I studied a variety of communities compris-  
ing females of all colors, I was able to create a multi-site ethnography (Hine  
2000). In conducting all of the research, I had a first hand, day-to-day view of  
the Xbox Live culture as well as a segment of its members for a period of  
seven months.  
The sample was drawn from the Xbox Live community and of all the indi-  
viduals who agreed to participate, only 12 were able to be included in the study  
(given the nature of gaming, many individuals were under the age of 18 and were  
excluded). The original participant solicitation only generated three interviews  
but I relied on snowball sampling to collect a larger population. Although this  
is a rather small sample, this is an unknown population and the research is  
merely exploratory. This research was used as a baseline to measure the experi-  
ences of women within Xbox Live. The data-gathering process comprised indi-  
vidual and group interviews about identity, linguistic profiling, and inequalities and oppressions in Xbox Live. Institutional review board (IRB) approval was  
granted prior to conducting any interviews.
### Results and analysis
The data within this study were collected from the interviews of twelve women  
– eight African-American and four Puerto Rican although they all identified  
racially as Black. Descriptive information on these women is listed in Table 1  
(pseudonyms were created to not reveal actual gamertags although my actual  
gamertag is used within this paper).  
These women had grouped themselves into clans within Xbox Live. A clan is  
similar to a guild as seen in computer gaming and is a group of players who play  
together in online gaming. Many clans coordinate matches to play other clans  
and log their scores into online scoring systems. From my observations, this  
coordinated activity does not occur in all games and is seen most often in first  
and third person shooter games such as Gears of War and Call of Duty (all  
installments).  
Many game researchers have studied the motivation behind joining guilds  
and clans within online gaming and found that most players join guilds to stra-  
tegize within the game and complete difficult objectives (Ducheneaut et al.  
2007); guilds are also very popular given that Seay et al. (2004) found that 78  
percent of online gamers were members of guilds. Guilds/clans are not orga-  
nized in this manner within Xbox Live and clan membership is not imperative  
to completing objectives. However, from my observations, clan membership is  
imperative to women in Xbox Live to ensure a positive gaming experience.
All the participants agreed that the problem within Xbox Live is based on  
linguistic profiling although they did not employ this term. They suggested  
that when a motivated offender hears a female or a Black sounding individual,  
then that motivated offender would begin a process leading to acts of racism,  
sexism, and other inequalities.
### Linguistic profiling and intersecting oppressions
RQ1: How significant is the voice in fostering linguistic profiling and creating an  
inequitable space for marginalized bodies?  
From my observations and interviews, Black women in Xbox Live experience  
discriminatory acts resulting from the label of deviance placed upon their ascribed  
identities as recognized through their voice. Once their voices are heard within the  
space, they experience inequalities. Additionally, these women perceive males as  
the oppressor to avoid and White women as passive bystanders not understanding  
of their own victimization. Many women respond to males by avoiding and  
self-segregating or by engaging in griefing behavior if they encounter a male;  
however, this griefing behavior was not at all organized or collective. Furthermore,  
their actions were largely dependent on their clan membership.  
As I began systematically studying the organization of different clans, I uncov-  
ered many important features of the clan I am a member of, Conscious Daughters,  
which forced me to check my assumptions about the experiences of women of  
color within Xbox Live. Most importantly, many women in Xbox Live were  
not aware of their own marginalization within the space although many women  
created their own gaming spaces within Xbox Live to avoid gamers who may  
engage in racist or sexist language. When Conscious Daughters became aware  
of the marginalization of women of color within Xbox Live, they made it their  
purpose to reveal this marginalization to other gamers in Xbox Live. However,  
the purpose was lost many times as the following dialog between me (Mzmygrane)  
and MissUnique, an original member of Conscious Daughters, will reveal:  
Mzmygrane: Earlier you said that Black women in Xbox live had a slave men-  
tality – that they didn’t know they were free. Now we laughed  
when you said this, but what did you mean?  
MissUnique: You know exactly what I mean. It’s like the woman who gets  
beat and never leaves her husband. She doesn’t see anything  
wrong or she is so powerless she thinks she can’t do nothing  
about it. I think people have slave mentalities when they experi-  
ence something bad but don’t do nothing about it. And white  
folks can have slave mentalities too.  
Mzmygrane: Do you have any specific examples from your experiences  
gaming in Xbox?  
MissUnique: Hell yeah! I got a fucking ton of ‘em. You remember when we  
were playing that one clan, Hot Girls or Hot Bitches or some shit  
like that?  
Mzmygrane: Yeah  
MissUnique: Well I friended a couple of them and started private chatting  
with one. Well she was talking shit about us saying we wasn’t  
that good and we make women in Xbox live look bad. So you  
know I was pissed especially when I’m trying to just reach  
out to make some new friends. And I told her we just like  
getting on to have fun. We aint hard core gamers or nothing  
like that we just like to chill with ‘ar [our] folks. So she said  
that they practice wit dudes to make them better and I went  
into the whole spill about how we don’t really fuck with  
dudes no more in here and I told her why. I told her I was  
tired of being called bitch, black bitch, dyke bitch, or any vari-  
ation of bitch. She told my black ass to deal wit it. That’s just  
how it is. She tried to tell me I was being too got damn sensitive.  
And I told her she was a fuckin dumbass. So we went on and on  
with that for a while then she said we were better than them cuz  
we in college and shit. So she took that shit to a whole ‘notha  
level.  
Mzmygrane: Oh this was the girl that called us sell outs cuz we sound white?  
MissUnique: Yeah that bitch. So to me, she looking at the wrong shit. She so  
focused on us that she ignoring who the problem is
Our initial experiences with other women of color stemmed from our failure to  
address the privilege of our ascribed identities: educated, mostly heterosexual,  
and White-sounding. Personally, I neglected the fact that I embody virtual white-  
ness so being critical of hegemonic whiteness to others posed a problem. But  
aside from that oversight, this excerpt illustrates the failure of many women  
to see, recognize, and address the inequalities they experience within Xbox  
Live. The focus immediately went to the privileges held by other women as  
opposed to the privilege of being a male within the space. As MissUnique  
pointed out, the woman she encountered could not see that males posed a  
problem within the space. Further, many women directed their anger within  
the space towards one another as opposed to directing their energy towards  
males within the space. Many women within the study directed their energy  
towards those with privileged identities as the following discussion of Puerto  
Reekan Killaz will explain.  
The Puerto Reekan Killaz created a space that is essentially free from racism,  
sexism, heterosexism, and nativism. To ensure this space stays safe, they are  
strict in who they friend and let become a member of their clan. Even more  
importantly, these women are critical of anyone who does not understand their struggles as Latinas and will avoid these individuals. This may seem rather  
discriminatory but it is an appropriate response for them to deal with their nega-  
tive experiences. It is similar to women avoiding sexist men or Black’s avoiding  
racist Whites. These women also avoid African-Americans who are insensitive to  
their citizenship status although they are US citizens. From my observations and  
interviews with Puerto Reekan Killaz, I found that their intersecting experiences  
were amplified by not just their gender and race, but also by their citizenship and  
linguistic (in)abilities.
XpkX RicanMami: All I know is that only people just like you understand you.  
So there’s no way you can understand where we coming  
from. Now I know you being African-American and all  
you understand some of the struggle. But since we  
Latina as well, we got added shit to deal with. Again,  
not to take away nothin’ from you as a Black woman.  
Ok? So don’t get mad, I’m just being real like you want  
me to right?  
Mzmygrane: Yes that’s all I want. Digame. Let it out. Tell me how you feelin.  
XpkX RicanMami: . . . the point I was makin first is that people look at me and  
assume I’m not American. They think I’m a fucking illegal  
just cuz I’m Latina. So I got the race thing, the gender  
thing, and the citizenship thing to deal wit.  
Mzmygrane: I feel you. Language too.  
XpkX RicanMami: Shit yeah you right. Just cuz I talk with an accent people  
think I can’t speak English good. I just wish more Blacks  
would understand where we comin from. We aint trying  
to take over as the most oppressed. Ain’t no damn  
contest who the most fucked up minority is in this  
country. We all fucked up. I just wish people would recog-  
nize that we got it hard too. Especially Black people.  
From their experiences, they recognized the inability of males and other ethnic  
minorities to empathize with their experiences within the space. Individuals with  
privileged identities oftentimes take their privilege for granted. African-Ameri-  
cans have the privilege of citizenship over ethnic minorities who migrate from  
black and brown countries. This privilege leads to incidences of oppression in  
some cases as is seen above.  
The ideological framework of Militant Misses (MM) is a major shift from the  
other clans within the study. As women of color, they would rather play with  
males and endure racism, sexism, heterosexism, and other inequalities. MM  
explain that these acts of hate are a part of the gaming experience and women  
like me were too sensitive and should not be playing if I could not endure the  
hardships of the male space. 
The members of MM have a unique standpoint and although it varies from  
other women, it is not an unreasonable stance to take. No one wants to be  
referred to in a racist or sexist manner and they have figured out a way to  
avoid that. By excelling in the game, they have shifted the conversation so the  
focus is on the game – not who’s playing the game. However, the process  
involved to reach this point is problematic. The approach taken by the MM  
places the onus of the deviant body on women and places the burden of reducing  
inequalities in the space on us as well. Another interesting point to note is that no  
member of MM had a gender signifier in their gamertag further reducing their  
association with female gamers. The women within this clan did not share prior  
stories of discrimination with me as they refused to discuss that aspect of gaming.  
They did not engage in questions I had on identities or oppressions and would  
only answer questions related to the game. The members who did participate  
were once members of Conscious Daughters. As a favor, they conducted the  
interviews although they would not let me engage in this type of conversation  
with other members of MM.  
When asked the question ‘what could be done about inequalities within the  
space’, the MM responded saying that increased gaming skills would reduce  
instances of hate within Xbox. The following conversation outlines their stance:  
UReady4War2: Now mzmygrane, when you gon join our clan? I see you  
getting better?  
Mzmygrane: Nah I’m good. I remember playing wit yall one time and yall got  
mad at me cuz I couldn’t get no kills.  
UReady4War2: (Laughing) Well you got yo’ game up now, so you don’t have to  
worry about that.  
Mzmygrane: But that’s what I’ve been trying to ask you. Why is that so impor-  
tant to yall?  
UReady4War2: Because we won’t be taken seriously – duh.  
Mzmygrane: Taken seriously by who?  
UReady4War2: Dudes.  
Mzmygrane: Why is that so important to you? Do you feel you need a man to  
confirm who you are?  
UReady4War2: Hell naw.  
Mzmygrane: Then what is it. Explain it to me. Your entire thought process.  
Why yall practice so much. Why you so mean to the girls? Why  
yall won’t play other girl clans?  
UReady4War2: Ok ok ok chill. Everytime I talk to you, you always bringing  
up how women aint taken seriously. You always bring up all  
that racist and sexist shit. But you know they only bring that  
up when they aint got nothing else to talk about. Seriously,  
kiki, if you pay attention to when men do all that shit  
talking to yall, its because yall pissed them off by sucking  (  
begins laughing). Nah I’m just joking, kinda. But we aint had  
no dudes talk shit to us like that in a long time. They still talk  
shit, but they be mad that we just whooped dey ass in the  
game. We make them mad. They don’t make us mad  
anymore.  
Mzmygrane: But why are you so hard on women who just want to play for fun  
– like me?  
UReady4War2: Because there is a solution. There’s a way to not experience all  
that negative shit. Just get better at the game. Why wouldn’t  
you do that?  
Mzmygrane: Because I shouldn’t have to. Guys don’t have this burden. We do.  
And you are putting it back on us to deal with the burden. We’re  
not the problem. They are.  
UReady4War2: Fair enough. Just be ready to still be called bitch (laughing).  
The MM did not enjoy being oppressed within the space and had identified a  
means to avoid inequalities. However, as is outlined in the above excerpt, the  
responsibility falls upon women to alleviate the oppressions.  
The women of Puerto Reekan Killaz also discussed the heterosexism they  
experienced by Black males. From conversations witnessed during my obser-  
vations, many Black males assume that many female gamers are lesbian and  
tailor their speech to match this assumed view. Even though the Latina  
women in the study did identify as sexual minorities, there is no way to know  
that in the space. Preview the following excerpt to gain additional understanding:  
XpkX RicanMami: Dey assume dat we lesbians.  
XpkX MammaMia: Bitch we are.  
(all laughing)  
XpkX RicanMami: But dey don’t know dat. Dey assume dat because we don’t  
take no shit from dem. If you a strong black woman den  
you gotta be lesbian.  
YeahSheBlaze: The fact dat dey can’t control us make dem mad. So they start  
disrespectin us and we talk shit back. I tell dem dat I can fuck  
dey bitch or my bitch look better and dat make dem so mad.  
XpkX MammaMia: You right. Dats why dey get mad. They feel like we takin  
dey manhood.  
This excerpt reflects the continued view of many Black men and their fear of  
their manhood being usurped by Black women. Going back to traditional  
Black feminism, Black males were hesitant to incorporate Black women into  
the liberation movements as they viewed racism as the loss of manhood  
without considering the sexist experiences of Black women. Chicana feminists  
experienced a similar conflict as they were asked to vow loyalty to the culture) as opposed to being asked to embrace their racialized, gendered realities (Nieto  
Gomez 1997; Roth 2004). Even more disturbing, Conscious Daughters  
explained how many Black males are inclusive of women but only when they  
agree to fill a subservient role. There is an inherent desire for women to  
serve as mascots – reflecting an inferior view of women within this space.  
This is also a perspective seen in other areas of life as well, especially in male  
dominated spaces. The participants were not willing to be submissive and  
refused to be continued victims of discrimination which also impacted their  
decisions to create their own spaces. The above conversation also introduced  
the view of White women within the space. I was disheartened that no White  
women agreed to participate within this study to give voice to their own experi-  
ences within Xbox Live. But the women within the study did not shy away from  
discussing their opinion of White women within the space.  
From what the participants reveal, White women either do not view their  
experiences in the space as sexist or do not acknowledge it. They accept it as  
part of gaming in the male universe, very similar to MM. Many women within  
the study also realized the problem associated with unifying as a female collec-  
tive recognizing that White women are not entirely comfortable in the racia-  
lized gendered space that also frequently doubles as Black lesbian space –  
similar to the failure to unify during early feminist movements. Audre  
Lorde (2001) realized that the only way to build community and raise con-  
sciousness is to embrace each other’s differences. This failure is also present  
within the Xbox Live community. The participants could not understand  
why White women would not want join their gaming world as opposed to sub-  
jecting themselves to discrimination. But the Black women were not a unified  
group either and did not recognize this contradiction. But from the Black  
female perspective, White women encourage their own victimization by con-  
tinuing to engage with their oppressors.  
Several women within the Conscious Daughters clan created two ways to  
explain White women’s interactions with males within Xbox Live: tokens or tro-  
phies. From their view, trophies were attractive women that gamed with males  
but were mostly an invisible population. But when they do speak, they become  
immediate victims of sexual harassment and other acts of sexism. Tokens were  
viewed as females whose gaming skills were superb but were exploited at the  
hands of her male counterparts. They were bragging points for males within  
the space. From what the participant suggested, the women were proud to be  
viewed as equals to males and assumed that the exploitation was just a part of  
being ‘one of the guys’.  
From the interviews, many White women within the space refused to see  
males as the dominant oppressor. But White women did not in turn become  
the oppressor as was seen during the feminist movements (Roth 2004; hooks  
2009). Black women stated emphatically that White women never discriminated  
against them because of their race nor did they use racist language towards them.  The Black women within the space only experienced racism and/or sexism at the  
hands of males – Black and White – within the space.
### Conclusions and future directions
This project originated from my personal experiences with racism and sexism  
within Xbox Live as the opening narration revealed. Because many game scholars  
have taken a utopic or neutral approach to virtual communities, there has not  
yet been a critical study to document the negative experiences of marginalized  
bodies within virtual communities. Black feminist standpoint theory as well as  
intersectional theory were utilized to give voice and meaning to the complex  
issues of race, racism, gender, sexism, and other ‘isms’ that exists in virtual  
communities. Linguistic profiling was also used as a means to understand the  
origins of the inequalities within the space.  
The findings from my research indicate that there is a need to critically assess  
the experiences of non-traditional gamers in online communities. First, stake-  
holders (Microsoft, game developers, marketing industry) need to recognize  
the diversity of its console gaming population. They must also recognize that  
members of the default gaming population are deploying hegemonic whiteness  
and masculinity to the detriment of non-white and/or non-male users within  
the space. Before discussions on how to counteract racism and sexism can  
ensue, these things must be acknowledged especially given the popularity of  
Xbox Live.  
Scholarship must also move beyond the utopic view of online communities  
recognizing anonymity can no longer be fully achieved. Advanced technology  
within Xbox Live allows for gamers to hear one another (voice chats) and see  
one another as well (video chat). Identities can also be linked to the avatar although  
many gamers can opt for the avatar to bear no resemblance to the true self. As has  
been disseminated in the literature, there is this mythical idea that the internet  
can help solve all of society’s problems. The ‘No one knows you’re a dog’ line  
has been overplayed and disputed on several occasions. But as Everett identifies  
with her research on Black women organizing in virtual space, the potential for  
positive change is there (Everett 2009). But within this online gaming space,  
who is responsible for ensuring equality? Audre Lorde discusses the problem  
with the view that women are responsible for extending their own equality  
which was a stance taken by many women within this study, namely the MM:  
Women of today are still being called upon to stretch across the gap of male  
ignorance and to educate men as to our existence and our needs. This is an  
old and primary tool of all oppressors to keep the oppressed occupied with  
the master’s concerns. Now we hear it is the task of women of Color to  
educate white women-in the face of tremendous resistance-as to our existence, our differences, our relative roles in our joint survival. This is a  
diversion of energies and a tragic repetition of racist patriarchal thought. In  
light of these facts, the women decided to forge their own movement, the  
Black Feminist Movement. (Lorde 2001, p. 27)  
Lorde has accurately assessed what occurred with many Black women within the  
Xbox Live gaming space. Noting Lorde, many gamers suggested that it was not  
their responsibility to have the normative gamer notice her within the gaming  
spaces. Nor does she feel it is her responsibility to educate White women on  
sexism. Because they are the continual victims of intersecting oppressions  
within the Xbox Live gaming space, many refuse to be continued victims.  
Drawing on Patricia Hill Collins’s work, the women in this study have  
understood their oppressed status and have made sense of their experiences.  
This actually negates the prevailing view held of oppressed groups – that they  
identify with the powerful and have no valid interpretation of their own oppres-  
sion (Collins 1998). This view also holds that the oppressed are less human than  
their rulers and are incapable of articulating their own standpoint (Collins 1998).  
As Collins confirms, Black women have refused to become victims and have  
resisted becoming passive bystanders. This resiliency continues throughout the  
lives of Black women and they have translated this to the online gaming space  
of Xbox Live.
