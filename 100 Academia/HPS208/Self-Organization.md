# Self-Organization

> [!info]+ Key Terms
> 1. Natural purposes
> 2. Self-organization
> 3. Invariance explanation

- **Natural purposes**
    - Walsh’s term for how we should think about living things
    - % Kant comes up with this
        - Walsh says: Kant was basically correct, except he draws slightly different conclusions
    - Walsh is going to employ two different notions of self-organization to get to that conclusion:
        - Kant’s notion
        - Other is the 20-21st century of self-organization that we see in complexity science
    - & Going to make the case that using something like self-organization and modern biology, we can understand how living things are both completely *explainable mechanically* and also *explainable as natural purposes* (goal-driven, goal-oriented things)
        - Kant says: there’s two ways of explaining things, and you cannot have both
        - Denis Walsh says: Why not both?
            - Going to do that by talking about what it “is” to explain something
                - Using one model of explanation that is reasonably popular and well-regarded: **invariance explanation**
                    - Explain something by talking about what would happen if things were a bit different
                    - Under what conditions does it still happen?
                    - One version of this type of explanation at the mechanical level
                    - Another version of this type at the goal-driven organism level
                    - They are compatible with each other

## Review: What is a Machine?

Recall [[Mechanism and Microbiology]]:

> [!summary]+ What is a machine?
> 1. Describable by blueprints — a list of parts and how they fit together
> 2. Designed to efficiently perform a specific function
> 3. Follow the same sequence of steps every time to achieve that function
> 4. You can start and stop the machine without it falling apart

- Nicholson thinks machines have these properties
    - Cells do not have these properties (or nearly as much as a mechanical watch does)
    - → Should not use the machine metaphor for cells
- Could not reasonable come up with a blueprint for cells
    - Cells are squiggly and wiggly; things move around, and it works by moving around semi-randomly
- Machine is designed to efficiently perform a single function
    - Nicholson argues that cells have tradeoffs between efficiency and robustness
    - Bunch of different ways to do a given thing
    - Parts bounce off around each other → allows them to do the thing, but maybe not as efficiently as a machine would, which only has one way of getting from A → B
- Cells do not follow the same sequence of steps every time
    - Not only do they have different sets of steps they can go through to achieve a given function, but:
        - Cells seem to be stochastic from top to bottom
        - Randomness of a cell is not really incidental
            - Not really noise
            - It is how a cell really works
- You can freeze a watch and take it apart to understand its parts separately and put it back together
    - Cannot do this with cells

## Cells and Organisms

- % Nicholson’s argument was just about *single cells*
    - Some organisms are just one cell
        - e.g., protozoa, some algae, some fungi

Suppose we think Nicholson is right about cells.

> [!question]+ Should we therefore conclude that multicellular organisms are not machines either?

> [!question]+ If we are not machines, what are we?

- Premise 1:
    - Cells are not machines
- Premise 2:
    - Living things are made out of cells
- Conclusion?
    - Living things are not machines in general? Not just single-celled organisms
    - Some people think this is not a conclusion
        - Why?
- & Maybe we should not jump from Nicholson’s conclusion that cells are not machines → all living things are not machines?

## Reading

> [!tldr]+ Denis Walsh’s “Organisms as natural purposes: The contemporary evolutionary perspective”
> - Proposes that we should think of **==organisms as natural purposes==**

- % This is what Kant thought we have to see living things as if we want to understand them
    - ! But also cannot do this *mechanistically*
- This idea that living things are goal-oriented has been banished from biology during scientific revolution
    - Walsh thinks: bring it back
    - Enough good reason to think that this is not only allowable but helpful way of analyzing living things
        - Especially under evolution; living things changing over time
- Basically trying to say that Kant was more or less right

## Equilibrium vs. Goal Directedness

Recall [[Plant Intelligence#Goal-Directed Behaviour]]:

- Walsh’s three criteria for goal-directedness:
    - **Persistence**
        - If you are trying to get to a goal and get knocked off that goal, you should re-oriented and re-organize yourself to get back towards that goal
    - **Plasticity**
        - Flexible strategies
        - Can change
    - **Repertoire**
        - Have a wide repertoire of things to do
        - Select one in that context to work towards goal
- → A ball rolling down a bowl is not a goal-directed behaviour
- But living things do fit these criteria
- Walsh (2006):
    - & Argues that living things have a wide repertoire of ways to make themselves
    - & Living things try to pick just those parts of their repertoire that let them live and thrive
    - & This goal-directedness of **ontogeny** (development) has consequences for how we should think about *evolution*
        - Process of ontogeny is goal-directed
        - The way that we make ourselves has the aim of allowing us to live and flourish
        - Need to understand this to understand evolution as well

## The Unity of Organisms

> [!quote]+ “I would provisionally say that a thing exists as a natural end if it is cause and effect of itself.”
> (Kant, quoted in Walsh 2006)

- % This is the *unity* that Kant and Walsh want to identify as goal-directed
- Tree is an *organized whole*
    - & Tree is the cause of leaves, roots, etc.
        - Roots do not spontaneously generate out of nowhere
        - Need the overall structure of the tree to get the leaves
    - & And the tree is also the effect of the leaves, roots, etc.
    - Tree is produced by its parts and also produces its parts
        - Both do it this way to keep the other thing going
- **Unity of an organism**
    - Is the unity of its natural purposiveness towards keeping itself going

Take this unity of organisms as a fact.

> [!question]+ What should we conclude from this?

### Newton of a Blade of Grass

> [!thm]+ Kant’s conclusion
> We can never have a science of living things.

- Science deals in mechanical causes
- Mechanical causes are *insufficient* to understand living things
- Therefore, no science of living things

### The Origin of Species

- Walsh notes:
    - & Most people think Darwin provided the answer to Kant’s dilemma
    - & Evolution by natural selection is a mechanism
        - Explains why organisms have forms that look both unified in themselves and fitted to their environments
        - Blind process that acts independently of anyone picking and choosing
- Answer to Kant’s dilemma:
    - Translate any apparent ‘purpose’ talk into ‘as if’ talk
- It is as if the tree is trying to stay alive
    - Why does the tree look as if it is trying to stay alive?
    - If its ancestors did not look like they were trying to survive, they didn’t!

## Your Genes and You

- Last time:
    - Talked about the development of evolutionary theory in the 100 years or so after Darwin’s Origin of Species
    - @ Get a picture of how your genes relate to your adult form
- Prevailing view:
    - & Genes are a kind of *blueprint* of the adult form of living things
    - Genes *program* the body
- Something like this picture is necessary for Darwin’s theory to be a complete answer to Kant
    - To explain organic form using just natural selection:
        - & Needs to be that genes have clear consequences for organic form
        - You have individual, separable genes
        - Those genes code for traits of the adult form
        - That adult form is acted on by natural selection
        - And that is what changes the gene frequencies over time
    - Ideally:
        - Each gene would contribute the plan for one ‘trait’
            - e.g., blood type, eye colour
        - That trait would either contribute to or reduce the fitness of the organism
            - i.e., each trait has somewhat separable effects on your ability to survive or reproduce or get genes into next generation

### Organisms as Middle-Men

- If we define evolution as “changes in gene frequency in a population”:
    - $ Organism barely features in evolution
    - Organisms run the genetic code
        - ! But they are not the thing undergoing selection
        - Only genes are selected
    - Organisms are not where selection has effects
        - Only *populations* show this
        - e.g., no one ever died from “natural selection”
        - Natural selection is not a force that acts on individuals
            - You do not reproduce because of natural selection
            - Don’t die from it
            - Not a thing that happens at the individual level
            - We model it at the population level
    - & A *population* of individuals undergo natural selection; not a single individual

### Genotype-Phenotype Mapping

- That picture where you can understand evolution by natural selection → therefore solve Kant’s problem using just genes and population
    - Depends on a regular or sensible mapping of genotype (what genes you have) to phenotype (what body/structure you have)
    - Point of the blueprint is that there is a structural similarity between the picture and the thing you are trying to build
    - Supposed to be a pretty clear mapping

> [!warning]+ Problem with this picture
> - According to Walsh:
>     - Genes do not straightforwardly code for the traits we care about
>     - Genes code for **proteins**
>         - That is it

- Gene was defined as something that codes for traits
    - Now we know that genes are sequences of DNA
    - DNA codes for *proteins*
    - DNA tells you which order of amino acids go in a protein
    - That is a kind of trait: which protein you make?
        - But not eye colour, shape of bones, etc.
- Turns out to be much more complex than was assumed to understand how a given gene contributes to aspects of our form
    - Called the **genotype-phenotype mapping question**
- Mid-20th century picture of evolution:
    - Assumed a pretty straightforward connection between genotypes and phenotypes
    - Were aware that maybe one trait had more than one gene involved
        - Or maybe one gene does more than one trait
    - Turns out to be even weirder than that

#### Bean Bag Genetics

- Picture of one gene and one trait has sometimes been called **bean bag genetics**

> [!quote]+ “The Mendelian was apt to compare the genetic contents of a population to a bag full of colored beans. ==Mutation was the exchange of one kind of bean for another==. This conceptualization has been referred to as “beanbag genetics”. Work in population and developmental genetics has shown, however, that ==the thinking of beanbag genetics is in many ways quite misleading==. To consider genes as independent units is meaningless from the physiological as well as the evolutionary viewpoint.”
> Mayr, Animal Species and Evolution, p. 263

- The formalization of population genetics treats one gene as an entirely separable thing
    - People were aware that this was an idealization
    - Hope was that this was an innocent idealization
        - Will add corrections once science gets grounded
        - But can nonetheless assume how this works:
- **Bean bag genetics**
    - Add a bunch of jellybeans in a bag
        - All of those are genes and code for single traits
    - Mutation is taking one jellybean out and putting in another
    - That is how evolution works: just swapping out jellybeans

## Evolvability

- Consider trying to create new computer programs by randomly swapping out lines of code
    - & Randomly changing one line of code in a computer program (or one connection in the circuits of your laptop) is wildly *unlike to improve* it
    - Likelihood of catastrophic failure is pretty high!
        - If you swap two lines of code around, it will likely break
- Yet, according to 2011 study:
    - $ Average human has on the order of 40 novel mutations in our genetic code
        - “Variation in genome-wide mutation rates within and between human families.” Nature genetics 43, no. 7 (2011): 712-714.
    - How is it that we do not break like a computer program would? How do we still metabolize?

> [!def]+ Evolvability
> - Ability to undergo adaptive evolution

- Computer programs, electronics are low evolvability
    - Not designed for evolvability
- & If any little change collapses the whole system, that is *low evolvability*
- ! But if major changes make no difference: still *low evolvability*
- Need the right balance between those two
    - ! Not obvious how you get that from bean bag genetics

## Development

> [!important]+ Walsh argues
> - Bean bag picture of what genes contribute to life is *not adequate* for understanding organismal development
> - Particularly thinks that:
>     - Organisms are highly *plastic* (can change) in a way that lets us be *adaptive*
>         - In terms of not just *behaviour* but its *development* and *ontology*
>     - Call this **adaptive plasticity**
>         - Organisms are very plastic and can change in a way that allows us to be adaptive, cope with a wide variety of circumstances
>     - Part of what makes adaptive plasticity possible is the **modularity of development**

### Modularity of Development

- ? How can you have little changes to one or two (or 40) genes and the whole system does not crash? Nonetheless, the whole thing is capable of changing?
- Naive picture of how genes work:
    - Body goes through the whole genome at once
        - Top-to-bottom, reading like a book
        - Transcribes everything
    - And does it again
    - Not how it works at all!
- Genes do not act by themselves
    - Genes are not on/off
- & Each gene has an *activity level*
    - Which can be tuned up or down by a variety of factors
    - Can be expressed to a greater or lesser degree
        - That is why you can have different cell types in body
        - Liver and skin cells are different because they have different patterns of gene activity
        - Patterns of activity are not set when you are born
        - Gene expression can go up or down throughout lifetime
- & Activity level of one gene can tune up or down the activity level of other genes
    - Some set of connections like this between the activity of genes is called a **gene regulatory network**
        - Genes activate and deactivate each other
        - Their level of activity regulate the activity of other genes

![](https://i.imgur.com/SZILbdh.png)

- ! Not the case that every gene equally affects every other gene
    - Not completely holistic in that way
    - Genes tend to *cluster* into these modules
- $ Gene regulatory networks seem to be *modular*
    - Have a lot of connections with some small collection of genes
    - And relatively few with others
- Walsh argues:
    - Each of these modules have some biological job to do
        - In that sense, they have *goals*
    - Changing one gene → overwhelming likely that there are several genes in that module that contribute to the function of the module → so the module can keep going on just fine/doing something different
- Within a module:
    - & Many changes can be buffered by other genes
    - Changes within a module do not necessarily cause changes to other modules
- If you get enough change or module changes radically:
    - Can have changes in the phenotype that are fairly dramatic
    - Without changing everything else about the organism
- When genetic changes do cause phenotypic changes:
    - & Modularity allows those changes to be relatively local
        - e.g., changes to the length of a particular bone do not necessarily cause all the bonds in the body to length
        - Want to have changes occur in one part of the organism, but not the whole organism at once
    - *Feedback mechanisms* within modules allows for other parts to accommodate those changes in an adaptive way

> [!summary]+ The relationship between genes and traits turns out to be wickedly complex
> - Involves a lot of feedback and regulation between genes that depends on a lot of stuff
>     - Not just the activity of genes
>     - But the environment that the genes find themselves in
>         - Degree of the expression of any given gene changes throughout life in response to environmental changes
>             - i.e., what you are doing
>             - e.g., genes that make muscles get more expressed if you go to the gym all the day
> - Change in the way your genes respond in your attempts to live and flourish in ways that enter into these complex feedback loops that are integrated in the way your organism is running itself
> - ! Bean bag genetics is bad!

## Phenotypic Accommodation

- ? What does any of this have to do with evolution?
- % Genes is not just a big huge mess, but also there are a bunch of parts embedded in parts that are regulating their own activity in relation to other parts
    - Have to understand how modules are interacting to understand what any given one of them are doing
    - Have to understand how modules interacting is embedded in environment

<!-- break -->
- If you do not understand the ways in which living things have a bunch of possibilities and which possibility they realize depends on:
    - (1) how other parts of them are doing, and
    - (2) how they are relating to their environment
        - Which is all to say that living things are plastic and have a repertoire
        - And they choose from that repertoire to get them towards their goal(s)
    - & If you do not understand this, you will not understand *evolution*
- If you want to understand ==changes in gene frequency in a population== (classic definition of evolution by natural selection)
    - Will need to know how they are involved with building the body and how the body is trying to deal with the world
    - In fact:
        - & It is the organism trying to deal with the world that leads the genes
        - **Organism-led** evolution rather than gene-led
- Rather than evolution just being a bunch of random mutations that either work or do not:
    - Argument here is that ==organisms build themselves body appropriate to the circumstances they find themselves in==
    - That is what selection acts on: organisms
        - Does not act on genes
    - In some sense:
        - Evolution cannot see genes
        - Because genes are not reproducing themselves individually
        - They get reproduced as a kind of collection, which gets embedded in an organism
        - Organism is the thing that either drives or does not

> [!def]+ Phenotypic accommodation
> - The phenomenon of organisms developing bodies to fit novel circumstances, with no genetic change

- When you have a living thing change the way it builds the body based on circumstances
    - → changing the way the genes have/do not have fitness
    - e.g., Slijper’s goat
        - Two front legs are paralyzed
        - Has to get around by hopping and walking on its back legs

> [!quote]+ “When the goat died an accidental death at the age of 1 year, Slijper dissected it and published a description of its altered morphology, which included changes in the bones of the hind legs, the shape of the thoracic skeleton and sternum, changes in the shape and strength of the pelvis, which developed an unusually long ischium. Changes in the pelvic muscles included a greatly elongated and thickened gluteal tongue whose attachment to the bone was reinforced by a novel trait, a set of numerous long, flat tendons.”
> West-Eberhardt p.611

- $ Many of the novel, adaptive traits this goat had look like the kind of thing that bipedal animals (like humans) have
    - e.g., pelvis looked (somewhat) like a human pelvis
    - % Example of the *plasticity* of organisms keeping them adaptive under totally novel circumstances

> [!important]+ West-Eberhardt argues: when we think of genetic change due to natural selection, we should keep this in mind
> - & The *phenotype* will adapt to specific circumstances
> - The selective pressure genes face is shaped by the ways the phenotype
> - & So the ==organism *leads* the genes== in a sense
>     - Rather than the other way around

> [!quote]+ “Without developmental plasticity, the bare genes and the impositions of the environment would have no effect and no importance for evolution.”
> (West-Eberhard, 2005, p.6544)

- Genes with fitness values exposed to an environment
    - Is not enough to understand why and how gene frequencies change over time
- If you want to understand why you have the genes you do:
    - Need as part as the story that those genes were involved with building the body
    - And that body was trying to survive and achieve its goals
- & If you do not get that, then you will not have a reasonable picture of what selective pressure is acting on the genes
- e.g., if you get good orthopaedic shoes → good arch support → your arches are not as strong; body adapts to having arch support
    - That is phenotypic *plasticity*
        - Body adapts to the circumstances you put it under
    - For it to be phenotypic *accommodation*:
        - Takes longer
        - & The ways genes change over time have to be shaped by the certain way your phenotypic plasticity is expressed
        - Can make a bunch of bodies
            - One is going to be appropriate for the environment
            - Slowly gene change over time follows along with the type of body you have been building based on the very normal evolution by natural selection mechanisms

## Inheritance and Organisms

- For natural selection to *act*:
    - Needs to be *heritable variations* which affect *fitness*
- But as we have seen:
    - $ Identical genes do not mean identical organisms
        - Due to phenotypic plasticity
- $ And non-identical genes do not always mean differences in phenotypes
    - See that in the modularity in buffering stuff
- & What is inherited then seems to be a host of *developmental resources*
    - Which each living thing uses to creatively make and re-make itself
    - Genes are less a program for you than they are a *tool* the body can use to make and re-make itself

### The Piano Metaphor

- A metaphor (which seems to be attributable to a few different sources) suggests:
    - & The genome is like a **piano** with 30,000 keys
- Rather than a blueprint/program:
    - & It is a set of affordances, which can be ‘played’ in many different ways
    - Organism tries to play a tune which is harmonious
- % Intelligent designers like this because then the ‘somebody’ playing the piano must be God
    - Walsh argues that it is the **self-organization of the living thing** that plays the piano
        - Complex feedback loops of regulation cause the whole thing to fit together with itself
- Genome is not a program, but a *resource*
    - Cells have these resources → can make a bunch of proteins
- If you want to explain anything other than ‘DNA can make proteins’:
    - Have to talk about the way that the whole organism is organized

### The Stability of DNA

- Walsh notes:
    - The very existence of DNA is, in some sense, a *derived property*

![|400](https://i.imgur.com/xhoNw0F.png)

- DNA is an enormous and delicate module
    - Constantly being damaged by various chemical processes
        - e.g., UV light
- A variety of cellular processes identify DNA damage and repair it
    - Cell does this by either:
        - Directly repairing the damage, or
        - Cutting out the damaged section and re-synthesizing it

## The Organism Centred View

> [!def]+ “On the organismcentred view the capacities of organisms, by which Kant identifies them as natural purposes – their self-organization, self-regulating, goaldirected capacities – constitute the ground for the possibility of suborganismal, replicator biology.”
> (Walsh, p.780)

- For genes to do anything and exist at all:
    - Need to have the context of the organism
    - One strand of DNA by itself is not going to last long
        - Not going to have the ability to reproduce itself
        - Not going to have fitness values
        - By itself: just a quasi-periodic crystal that is just going to be degraded by the environment
- If you want to understand why genes exist at all and why they have the capacities they do (part of the developmental toolkit that your body uses to make and re-make itself):
    - Have to see it in the whole context of the organism
- Formalization of something like population genetics treats fitness of genes as an *intrinsic* property of the gene
    - So that you can look at the part
    - Can you understand the whole in terms of the parts?
        - Yes; can understand how genes contribute to how a body develops and builds itself
        - But those genes are not like bits of a mechanical clock
            - Which stay put and have properties that exist independent of the whole

> [!important]+ To understand why they do what they do, how they do what they do, and indeed why they exist in the first place, you need to understand them in the *context* of the rest of the living thing

- Recall Kant:
    - Leaves exist because of the tree; tree exists because of the leaves
    - There is a reciprocal, top-down, bottom-up causation here
    - Leaves are for the sake of the tree
    - Tree generates the parts (leaves)
- Walsh is basically doing something like that, but with organisms and genes
    - If you want to understand why these genes come about, and why you have the ones that you do, and how they have the capacities they do, you cannot ignore the organism!
    - If you want to understand the organism, should probably have a sense of genes
        - Molecular biology is how you build a self
        - Those are the mechanisms by which you construct a body
        - If you do not get that we have genes that code for proteins → missing a crucial part of the story
        - But it is not just the genes are programming and building us
        - & There is a reciprocal causation here; exactly the type that Kant contributed to all living things
- ? Is Kant right? Does that make biology forever an impossible, ruled-out thing?
    - Walsh hopes that is not the case
    - Walsh going to make the case that:
        - Can accept two parts of Kant’s dilemma
    - ? How does he do that without contradiction?

### Explaining Individuals and Explaining Regularities

- Walsh suggests:
    - & Viewing organisms as mechanisms and viewing them as natural purposes are *complementary*
    - Says that there are two perspectives here:
        - Bottom-up mechanical view
        - Organismal purpose-driven view
    - Says they are complimentary
        - They explain two different things
        - Explain two different features of the *same* thing
- In principle:
    - & Could explain every molecular interaction in the body of any living thing
- But if you want to understand why it has the form it does, or why organismal forms in general are the way they are:
    - & Need to see it as a natural purpose

> [!example]+ Consider a class of students who all read at a third grade level
> - Could want to know, of each student *individually*, why they can do that
> - Or could ask about the class as a whole
> - Why does the whole group read at a third-grade level vs. why do each of them individually read at a third-grade level
>     - You cannot be in third grade if you cannot read at a third-grade level vs. each individual kid might have different stories for reading at a third-grade level (one had really good teachers, one was home-schooled, etc.)
> - Different explanations will be relevant

- You are asking about the same objects and kind of the same question
    - But one is pitched at the level of regularity and other at the level of individual that constitutes the regularity
- Walsh is saying:
    - & If you want to understand why living things in general tend to look like they are purpose-driven, you need to understand them organisms that are trying to survive the world
    - & If you want to understand why each individual organism is the way it is, you probably want a mechanistic story

## Robustness and Self-Organization

- Walsh wants to understand the way living things put themselves together in terms of **robustness** and **self-organization**
- Hurricane
    - Is a self-organized system
        - In the sense that it has lower entropy than wind just going any which way
    - Can perturb a hurricane quite a bit, and it will *re-form*
        - & It is a *robust* phenomenon
    - But that robustness ==does not depend on the exact initial conditions or any particular arrangement of molecules==
    - Rather:
        - It is a property of the system as an organized whole
- & Our status as natural purposes is like this
    - Walsh argues
- We are *agents*
    - Adapting to our environments to live and flourish
- & Can look like a lot of different things at the molecular level
- And what we now know is that ==the molecular level of our bodies self-organizes in a way that keeps us robust against perturbations==
    - Part of the stuff about the modularity of development and the gene-regulatory networks
    - Can have perturbations in the ways your genes functions or even which genes you have
    - Perturbations are buffered out by the way the system as a whole is organized

## The Unity of Organisms

> [!question]+ So, why does it look like organisms have this property of being both cause and effect of themselves?
> - For any given organism:
>     - There is a *mechanical* explanation for any feature they have

- But Walsh thinks that if we want to know why living things appear to have *purposes*:
    - Need to appeal to their overall *structural* features
        - Mechanical is just ‘nuts and bolts’ of the microbiology of how we exist
        - Purpose is an overall structural feature
            - Overall in the sense that not every detail is necessarily relevant
            - Microbiological details could have been different, but if you keep the goal the same, the details would have re-organized itself to stay aimed at that goal
- & Purposive behaviour is an emergent property of living things
    - & Explained by their organization

## Ways of Explaining

- This claim is about explanation and understanding
- Walsh is *not* claiming there is some mysterious force of self-organization at play here
    - & Rather, there are *two* different styles of explanation required
- ? But having explained living things in terms of mechanical causes, is there room for anything else?
    - How do you explain once there is nothing left to explain (because we have it all down mechanically)?

### Invariance Explanation

> [!note]+ Not on exam

- Walsh asks us to consider one modern theory of explanation
    - The **Invariance** account
- **Invariance explanation**
    - From James Woodward
        - Philosopher of science who has no strong opinions about organismal form, etc.
        - Just trying to understand how explanation works
    - & To explain something is to identify the factors that make a difference to it

#### Difference Makers

- & Finding an explanation is then about finding difference makers
- If you ask: “why isn’t my car working?”
    - One possible answer is: “because you did not put gas in it”
    - If that is true, then in the scenario where you had put gas in it, it would run
        - Then this is a good explanation
    - If the problem is instead the spark plugs:
        - Then gasoline may not have been a **difference maker**
            - So it is not an explanation
- & What would have made a difference to the outcome is what explains the outcome
- Explanation is about counter-factual invariances

#### Mechanical Difference Makers

- % Woodward mostly has in mind ‘mechanical’ difference makers
    - If the first domino hadn’t been pushed, the next one would not fall, etc.
- But recall what we said about genes:
    - ! Our bodies are such that, very often, changing *one* gene does not change the sorts of bodies we have

#### Purposive Difference Making

- Walsh suggests that we can use this basic, invariance framework, but think about **differences in goals**
    - Organisms employ their adaptive plasticity to achieve various goals
    - If their goals change, then we can expect to see phenotypic accommodation
    - Changes in genes will then follow along with these changes in goals over time

#### Invariance Explanation

- Therefore, Walsh argues that:
    - & Purposes can do explanatory work just as well as mechanisms
- Purposes tells us what would have happened if things had been different
    - And they do that for a different set of possibilities than mechanisms
        - What if the overall organization had been different? vs. what if this gene had been different?
- Understanding why something happens involves understanding the difference makers
    - There is a full, complete mechanical story about how your body works
    - But also can tell a different story about difference makes!
        - & If you had different goals, then your body would have organized itself differently
        - And that is a complete explanation

## The Unity of Organisms

- So, Walsh claims:
    - & We can coherently say that living things are both caused by molecular mechanics, and their own *purposive* activities
    - Both perspectives are needed, and they do not conflict in the way Kant argued
