One can be an:
1. **Individual subjectivist**
2. **Cultural subjectivist**

## Individual Subjectivism

- Only individuals themselves determine what is moral
- Do not have to account for a deity or some objective fact that provides our moral grounds
- Does lead to some startling conclusions:
    - e.g., genocide under Hitler was morally good
        - To the Nazis, that was something that had to be done for some sort of moral greater good at the time

## Cultural Subjectivism

- Only groups of individuals determine what is moral
    - i.e., Morals and ethics are made up by us and come from us
- Societies will treat those morals as the correct ones
- Also referred to as **moral conventionalism** or **moral constructivism**
- States that morals can be judged by different cultures; each culture will treat their morals as the correct one
    - vs. individual subjectivism: others canâ€™t judge morals
