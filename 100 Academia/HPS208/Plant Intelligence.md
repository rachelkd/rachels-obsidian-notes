# Plant Intelligence

## Plant Sentience

> [!question]+ Why is it okay to eat plants?
>
> - In [[Hindu Environmental Ethics|Hinduism]] and Jainism:
>     - Considered okay (or at least better) to eat plants rather than animals
>     - Jain suggestion:
>         - Plants have less of a *sensory* world
>         - Therefore suffer less

- % Both Hindu and Jain traditions regard plants as *sentient*
    - Plants have *atman* — baseline witness consciousness that underlies all personality and conscious experiences
        - i.e., Plants have something of a soul
    - ! Not at all and uncommon view in the broad scope of how people have thought about plants
        - e.g., Vegetalistas of the Amazon:
            - Report that they learn the art of healing from plants themselves

### ASENT Criteria for Sentience

Recall ASENT [[Animal Sentience (ASENT)#Criteria of Sentience|Criteria for Sentience]]:

![[Animal Sentience (ASENT)#^648b51]]

#### Nociceptors and Nervous Systems

- **Nociceptors**
    - A type of neuron
- While there is some debate about what counts as a *brain*, no one thinks plants have a brain, much less integrative brain regions
- Plants fail all three neurological criteria

## Can Plants Behave?

> [!quote]+ Segundo-Ortin and Calvo (2020)
> “Overall, we hold that plant cognition encompasses behavioural patterns that are adaptive, flexible, anticipatory, and goal-directed.” (p. 3)

- Presumably, we do not really think of plants as “behaving”
    - Researches in this area talk about **plant blindness**
        - Most people in urban, modern environments do not pay much attention to plants

<!-- break -->

> [!question]+ What sense can plants behave at all?

> [!question]+ What could count as plant behaviour?
>
> - Such that we can even ask if it is adaptive, flexible, etc.
> - Maybe growing towards a direction/towards light?

## Movement

- Some plants do *move* on time-scales we can perceive
    - e.g., Mimosa Pudica
        - The “sensitive plant”
        - If you touch the little leaves, they will fold up for a while
- Can also think of **heliotropism**
    - Following the sun
- Can think of Venus Fly Trap
- Both the sensitive plant and Venus Fly trap reduce their movements in response to ==general anaesthetics==

### Darwin(s) On Plant Movement

- 1880 book by Darwin and his son
    - Describes various forms of movement in plants

> [!quote]+ The Power of Movements in Plants
> “It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle thus endowed \[with sensitivity] and having the power of directing the movements of the adjoining parts, acts like the brain of one of the lower animals; the brain being seated within the anterior end of the body, receiving impressions from the sense-organs, and directing the several movements.”

- Root-tip brain hypothesis
- Darwins did a bunch of experiments on plants’ root-tips:
    - e.g., Exposed it to light or damaged it
    - $ The tip and the rest of the root would respond (over a long time-scale)
        - Changed its behaviour in a way that looked adaptive
        - Something like a brain supporting something like adaptive behaviour

### Growth as Movement

- Modern researchers in this area also treat ==growth== as a type of movement
    - Obviously not how we think of ‘movement’ in animals, but
- If plant growth is adaptive, flexible, etc.:
    - Hard to see why it matters whether we call it movement

### Defence Mechanisms

- Maple and beech saplings
    - When eaten by deer, specific compounds in the deer saliva cause plant to ==ramp up tannin production==
        - Deer do not like tannin
        - Above the levels you would see from just cutting tree with knife
            - i.e., Cutting tree with knife does not ramp up tannin production
- $ This looks like a *defence mechanism*
- In some species:
    - Herbivores can respond to defence mechanisms
        - e.g., Giraffes will eat a little bit off a tree
        - Trees signal to other trees to ramp up tannin production
            - Chemicals are carried by wind
            - Trees upwind will taste fresh; downwind will taste bitter
        - → Giraffes move to a different tree upwind because tree tastes bad

> [!tldr] This example is part of a wide field that is called — possibly and cautiously — **plant communication**.

## Communication

- ! Should be cautious here in using the word *communication*
    - Word has a lot of connotations we do not necessarily endorse for plants
- What is clear is:
    - & Plants release various **Volatile Organic Compounds** (VOCs)
        - In response to stimuli — e.g., damage — which triggers responses in both kin and non-kin
        - e.g., Smell of freshly cut grass triggers defensive responses in other blades of grass

### Sensing Vibrations

- Cutting a tree with a knife does not increase tannin production, but deer-munching does
- ? How do trees know that?
    - Best explanation:
        - Trees can hear the munching

> [!quote]+ Segundo-Ortin and Calvo (2020) on p. 63
> “For instance, the model plant Arbidopsis thaliana can detect, through epidermal outgrowths (hairs called “trichomes”), the specific vibrations produced by the munching of caterpillars and respond to them by synthesizing toxins”
>
> (Appel & Cocroft, 2014)

- If a plant has just been brushed by wind or a person, it does not want to spend a lot of biological resources ramping up chemical production
    - But if there is a caterpillar on the plant, then it does
- Appel and Cocroft (2014)
    - Claims that the mechanism for how plants distinguish caterpillar munching from other things is ==sensing a specific pattern of vibration in the air==
    - *Hearing*-like behaviour

### Mutualism between Plants and Invertebrates

> [!tldr]- Munawar et al.
> Munawar, A., Xu, Y., Abou El-Ela, A. S., Zhang, Y., Zhong, J., Mao, Z., … & Zhou, W. (2023). Tissuespecific regulation of volatile emissions moves predators from flowers to attacked leaves.

- Wild potatoes:
    - Study found that predatory mites will usually hang out on top of the flowers, eating pollen
        - Plants are okay with this; no defence
            - Want pollen to spread to cross-fertilize
    - Herbivorous spider mites attack the leaves
        - Plant will change the VOCs
        - Attracting pollen-eater mites to move down to the leaves to eat the spider mites

### Mimickry

- Gianoli & Carrasco-Urra
    - Report that climbing vine *Boquila trifoliolata* appears to ==mimic== the leaves of the trees it climbs
- Single vine reaching multiple trees will grow ==different types of leaves==

![](https://i.imgur.com/jhlYn0L.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/RTfsa96.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/SpmJw7Q.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/InLCAL7.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/8GeF53H.png)

- ? Why does this happen?
    - Authors say: “We ==currently lack a mechanistic explanation for this unique phenomenon==.”
    - VOCs are briefly considered
    - So is **horizontal gene transfer**
        - Plants and single-celled organism are trading genes (like Pokemon cards)
        - Plants have rings of genes that are put out into the environment and taken up by other organisms that use up the little bit of genetics
- ! But, plants do not need to be touching for this mimicry to happen
    - Baluska & Mancuso (2016, 2017)
        - Speculate that it could be a form of *proto-vision*
        - Something like a light-sensing capacity in the vine
        - Pattern of light that falls on the leaves → Creates a pattern of its own leaves

## Plant Intelligence

> [!question] What does this mean?

- ! Responding to stimuli is not enough to say that something is *perceiving* the world
- If our question is a *moral* one:
    - This is not enough evidence, surely
    - & Simply acting in a way that looks intelligent can be accounted for in several ways that do not involve sentience

### Mechanical Intelligence

![](https://i.imgur.com/AdrQ68p.png)

- Consider the *Watt Governor*
    - % Machinery that looks like it is doing something goal directed
    - Has two heavy weights on it that rotates
    - Driven by gears connected to wheels of a train
    - However fast the wheels of the train is moving is how fast this thing is spinning
    - As it spins, the heavy weights are lifted up by centripetal force
    - Higher weights are lifted → Moves the shaft to throttle the fuel supply for train
        - → Less fuel for the engine
        - → Train slows down
        - → Makes weights go down
    - It is a governor
        - Regulates the speed of the train
- & Nobody would consider this machinery sentient

### Goal-Directed Behaviour

- In a sense, the Watt Governor is *goal-directed*
- Intuitively might think that plants are doing something goal-directed and therefore are sentient
    - But, Watt Governor example seems to argue otherwise
- We can call the Watt Governor goal-directed with some comfort
    - $\because$ Has an extrinsic goal, which humans gave to it
- & Humans have intrinsic goals
    - & Seems reasonable that plants do as well
- ? Do plants have intrinsic goals?
    - Is the apparent goal directed-ness of plants intrinsic to them?

> [!important]+ This question is relevant to our moral question.
>
> - If plants have goals, then they have ==interests==
>     - i.e., Things that they want out of the world
> - & → Have to give some consideration to their interests

#### Equilibrium vs. Goal Directedness

> [!warning] There is a debate about what we should call *goal directed*, if anything

- Disagreement on:
    - Whether a ball rolling  towards the bottom of a bowl should be called a simple form of goal directed behaviour
    - Some say that you should not call anything goal directed, unless if there is a person that can tell you literally what their goal is
- ? If this is goal-directed, then any system with an equilibrium point is goal directed.
    - @ Perhaps we want something more stringent in our definition

> [!summary]+ Walsh (2006)
>
> - Argues that for something to be *goal directed*, it should have three properties:
>     1. **Persistence**
>     2. **Plasticity**
>     3. **Repertoire**

- & Should persistently pursue a goal using flexible strategies drawn from a wide repertoire of possible behaviours
    - i.e., Should head towards its goal, and if it gets perturbed away from the goal, it should head back there
- Ball example does have persistence
    - If you knock ball away from middle of bowl, it will go back to middle of bowl
    - But also needs *plasticity* and *repertoire*
        - i.e., Flexible strategies from a wide repertoire of possible behaviours
    - Ball does not seem to have these qualities
        - Can only roll down until it has exhausted its potential energy

### Decision Making

> [!quote]+ Segundo-Ortin and Calvo (2020)
> “Trewavas (2014) reports that when exemplars of Calamagrostis canadiensis are offered adjacent habitats to grow, they ==choose the habitat with the best conditions of competition, warmth, and light==. However, C. canadiensis can also “==discriminate== these conditions in combination \[…] ==choosing light plus warm soil in preference to others==” (p. 84).”
>
> (p.4)

- Recall ASENT criteria:
    - Motivational trade-offs that show a balancing of threat against opportunity for reward
- C. canadiensis chooses to grow in the direction that has the best resolution to the multiple variables it considers towards its *goal* for staying alive
    - Looks kind of like *decision making*

### Learning and Memory?

- Recall ASENT criteria:
    - Associative learning that goes beyond habituation and sensitization

> [!tldr]+ Barry E. Adelman (2018): On the Conditioning of Plants: A Review of Experimental Evidence
>
> - Secondary reading
> - & There is not much evidence for complex associative learning in plants at present

- Adelman (2018)
    - Example of literature where people take experimental paradigms from behavioural psychology and applying them to plants

#### Habituation

- Mimosa Pudica does show stimulus-specific habituation
    - The sensitive plant
- Holmes and Gruenberg (1965)
    - Report that dripping water on M. Pudica’s leaves causes it to slowly stop responding to water drops
    - Touching it with a finger would still elicit the folding up response

#### Gagliano Et Al. (2016)

- Strongest evidence Segundo‐Ortin and Calvo review for associative learning
    - Comes from Gagliano et al. (2016)

![](https://i.imgur.com/FL2TfxM.png)

- Took pea plants
    - Tested whether they could be conditioned to grow towards a gently blowing fan
    - Fan was either paired (or not, in the control) with blue light
    - ~ The plants want the light
    - ? Can plants be taught to associate blowing fan with blue light?
        - Pavlov-dog style
        - Without the fan, if you blow a fan down one arm of the tube, will the pea plant will grow towards the fan?
        - Can you train a pea plant to have this conditioned response to the blowing air?
- Gagliano et al. did find a statistically significant tendency to grow towards conditioned stimulus
    - i.e., The fan blowing
- ! Result failed to replicate in at least one follow up study
    - Markel (2020)

##### Markel’s Replication

> [!tldr]- Markel (2020)
> Markel, K. (2020). Lack of evidence for associative learning in pea plants. Elife, 9, e57614.

- Markel (2020)
    - Ran the experiment again
    - Found a ==null== result
    - Used a larger sample size and “blinded” scoring

#### Conclusions about Learning and Memory

- Adelman (2018)
    - & Found that the only promising evidence for conditioning that goes beyond habituation in plants was Gagliano et al. (2016)
    - ! Markel (2020) was unable to replicate Gagliano et al.‘s experimental results

> [!important]+ Absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence
>
> - But as of 2020:
>     - & Plants do not seem to fulfill this ASENT criterion for sentience

## Plant Consciousness

> [!summary]+ Final section of main reading (Segundo‐Ortin and Calvo, 2022)
>
> - Various proposals which support the idea that plants are *conscious*

- ! Segundo-Ortin and Calvo treat *sentience* and *consciousness* interchangeably
    - ASENT paper does not
        - Distinguish them because of phenomena like *blind-sight* and *masked priming* effects
        - % Blind-sight
            - Someone can have no conscious experience of vision, but
            - In behavioural tests that have vision, they act like they have vision
            - e.g., Can navigate a room without bumping into things
            - Visual processing is happening, but have no conscious experience of vision
                - fMRI reveals that visual cortex lights up
            - & Can have integrated behaviour on some sense without consciousness
        - % Masked priming effects
            - Can see people’s integrated, goal-directed responses to stimuli they are not conscious of
            - If Freud is right at all, you should distinguish sentience from consciousness
