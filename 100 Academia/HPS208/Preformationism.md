# Preformationism

> [!info]+ Key terms
> - Preformationism
> - Epigenesis
> - Embryonic Development

## Review

- Last week:
    - Talked about the history of [[Mechanism|mechanism]]
- Mechanism replaced the Aristotelian worldview
    - Mostly
    - Aristotelian worldview had a picture that was intuitive, human-centred, full of things of meaning, purposes, goals
        - Matter interfacing with form
        - Form of a thing is as real as its matter
            - (and purpose)
        - Two are mutually required to make a thing into what it is
    - Reduced to ==matter pushing matter== (in mechanism)
- Mechanism was a good research strategy
    - Helped with a lot of research in physics, chemistry
    - Mechanism comes with an implicit research strategy:
        - Look at something complex
        - Break it down into parts
        - Understand the parts
        - Put it back together to understand the overall thing
    - For Descartes: cut the animal into parts, understand the parts, then put the parts back together (conceptually, for animals) to understand the whole thing
- While mechanism seems to have been a really good framework for thinking, it left something to be desired when applied to living things
    - When you cut a living thing into parts, it is not a living thing anymore
    - While physicists and chemists were trying to exercise all this teleological language of purpose and function:
        - Biologists the whole time were using purposive and functional language
            - e.g., Legs are for walking, eyes are for seeing, hearts are for pumping blood
                - Teleological language
    - You cannot do biology without using Aristotelian language

### Cartesian Dualism

- Descartes specifically thought:
    - Impossible to explain *human minds* mechanistically
- But was pretty okay with the idea that the rest of life could be explained mechanically

### This Week

- Talk about some struggles to reconcile *mechanism* with what was known about *living things*
    - Not just the human mind, but living things in general
- Lots of features of life are hard to explain mechanically
    - Focus specifically on **embryonic development**
        - Embryo to an individual to an adult
        - Still remains hard to explain to this day!

## Embryology in Aristotle

- Aristotle:
    - Reports having studied the development of embryos by opening chicken eggs
        - One per day of development
    - Saw development in terms of *matter* and *form*
        - & Sperm provides the *efficient*, *final*, and *formal* cause
        - & Eggs provide the *matter*
            - Saw eggs as unstructured matter; unformed
            - Sperm puts its form on that
    - & Saw development as the *==form of the animal imposing itself on unstructured matter==*
        - Start as an undifferentiated clump of cells
        - A bunch of very articulate parts put themselves together somehow
        - Aristotle sees this as *form imposing itself on matter*
            - Form is as real as matter for him
            - e.g., The form of a chicken was doing the work of turning the unstructured matter into a chicken
                - Doing that with the goal of producing a chicken
    - & Development is guided by its *purpose*
        - The development of the adult animal

> [!note]+ With those conceptual resources, Aristotle does not have much difficulty with embryogenesis.
> - Has the idea of form that exists semi-independently from matter
> - Has the idea of natural purposes
> - → Gives good machinery to explain embryology
>     - The egg wants to become a chicken (goal); has the form to get it there

### Pangenesis

![](https://i.imgur.com/9owHIiw.png)

- Aristotle specifically argues against some other theories of embryogenesis around the same time
    - His theory was opposed to others e.g., **pangenesis**
- **Pangenesis**
    - Hippocrates argued for this
    - & The idea that ==every part of the adult body contributes something to the sperm or egg==
        - It is those contributions which give it form
            - Those parts carry some picture of the overall body
            - Sperm, egg use to reconstruct the adult
        - e.g., to make a hand, you need hand gemmules; to make a nose, you need nose gemmules
            - Theory allows for the possibility of inheritance of acquired characteristics
                - e.g., if you work out everyday and get ripped, you have way more muscle gemmules; maybe, your kid gets more muscle gemmules
- % Roughly Darwin’s theory of hereditary
    - Comes up with theory of natural selection without having the benefit of microbiology
    - Thinks it is something like this

> “The races that differ but little from one another I will omit, and describe the condition only of those which differ greatly, whether it be through nature or through custom. I will begin with the Longheads. There is no other race at all with heads like theirs. Originally custom was chiefly responsible for the length of the head, but now custom is reinforced by nature. Those that have the longest heads like theirs. Originally custom was chiefly responsible for the length of the head, but now custom is reinforced by nature. Those that have the longest heads they consider the noblest, and their custom is as follows. As soon as a child is born they remodel its head with their hands, while it is still soft and the body tender, and force it to increase in length by applying bandages and suitable appliances, which spoil the roundness of the head and increase its length. Custom originally so acted that through force such a nature came into being ; but as time went on the process became natural, so that custom no longer exercised compulsion. For the seed comes from all parts of the body, healthy seed from healthy parts, diseased seed from diseased parts.”
>
> (Hippocrates De aere acquis et locis W. H. S. Jones, Ed. Part 14, section XIV)

- Alterations to the body inherited during its life can be inherited in this theory
    - Different from the DNA theory of hereditary
        - Germ-line and soma are fully separated
- % No one knows who the Longheads are that Hippocrates is referring to

### Family Resemblances: Pangenesis vs. Aristotle

- Pangenesis:
    - There is a clear explanation for why we resemble both biological parents
        - The mingling of gemmules of the two parents
- For Aristotle:
    - That needed some further explanation
        - Since sperm provides the form
        - Only the father who provides the form
    - Thought that *disturbances from the maternal side* caused deviations from perfect replication of the father
    - Failure to resemble father exactly is explained by ill humours in the mother or distress

## Malebranche and Preformationism

> [!tldr]+ Reading
> - Chapter from Karen Detlefsen’s *The Life Sicneces in Early Modern Philosophy*
> - About Malebranche’s theories about embryonic development

### Malebranche

- Nicholas Malebranche
    - 1638-1715
    - Catholic priest and philosopher
- Last week:
    - Saw Malebranche’s theory about the relation between bodies and minds
        - **[[Mechanism#Occasionalism|Occasionalism]]**
- % In general, his philosophy is pretty God-focused

### Preformationism

- Malebranche argued for a quite different picture of embryonic development
    - Despite being a big fan of Descartes
    - Preferred view was **preformationism**

> [!def]+ Preformationism
> - Idea that every structure in a living thing exists in the egg/sperm
> - Embryonic development is just feeding matter into pre-existing structures
>     - e.g., expanding a balloon

#### Preformationism: Two Types of Arguments

- Detlefson tells us that there are two basic lines of argument that Malebranche used to *defend preformationism*:
    - **Theological**
    - **Scientific**
- % Also briefly mentions metaphysical arguments from Liebniz

#### Two Theological Arguments

- % We will look at two distinct theological arguments
    - One is about *original sin*
    - Other is about *God’s role* in the *mechanical order of the universe*

#### Theological Argument 1: Original Sin

- **Original sin**
    - Idea that all of humanity was stained by Eve, when in the Garden of Eden, she ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil

Suppose you 100% believe that.

- ? How did that sin stain all of humanity?
    - You were not there at all!
- Preformationism says:
    - & You and I were there, in a very tiny form

<!-- break -->
- The structure of this argument is very weird
    - Trying to prove preformationism
    - The mystery is: How can I be stained by original sin when I was not even there?
    - Says: Well, preformationism explains that; therefore, preformationism is likely true
    - **Inference of the best explanation**
        - If this hypothesis is true, then I should make this observation $O$
        - I make this observation $O$, therefore, likely this hypothesis is true
        - e.g., If somebody stole all my money, then I am broke. I am broke, so probably someone stole all my money

##### Ovism and Spermism

- Two brands of *preformationism*
    - **Spermism**
        - Claims the mini-person is in the *sperm*
    - **Ovism**
        - Claims the mini-person is in the *egg*
    - % You cannot be both (unless you believe that one fights the other to death)
- & Malebranche was an **ovist**
- & We were all inside Eve when the first sin was committed
    - Inside eggs inside eggs inside Eve

#### Theological Argument 2: God the Maker

- Malebranche:
    - Preformationism opens up a perfect space for God to be a creator of all living things without having to constantly intervene
        - Avoids a very literal ‘deus ex machina’
            - God from the machine
            - A seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly solved by an unexpected event
- The world is mechanistic except for the human mind
    - Malebranche is okay with the idea that the human mind is an immortal soul; not a mechanism
    - But also wants the world to roughly be mechanistic
        - Thinks it is a machine unfolding itself
        - Thinks it should not be the case that God is constantly having to get in there to change stuff

##### Occasionalism

- Contradiction?
    - From [[Mechanism#Occasionalism|mechanism]]:
        - Malebranche thought that God intervenes every time we think the mental and physical interact
            - Every time you think that you have a physical sensation — that something material is causing something to happen in your mind — that is God doing a runner between the two
            - Any time you have something physical that causes something physical, God is intervening there
- ? How could “God the Maker” possibly be an argument that Malebranche wants to endorse given that he also thinks that God does everything always?

##### Simple and General Laws

- Malebranche:
    - Reconcile these using another claim he makes about how God governs the world
- It is a mechanistic world
    - What mechanist means is:
        - God has chosen some simple and general laws to govern the whole universe
        - Mostly sticks by them
        - & God can violate these laws at will in the case of miracles
            - Mostly lets things follow them
            - Occasionally, when he wants to turn water into wine, or make a bush burn, he will allow there to be exceptions to the general laws

#### God the Maker

- For Malebranche:
    - Would be bad for God to be regularly intervening in the course of events in a way that *violates the laws of nature*
- & Preformationism allows for God to have designed us each as individuals
    - Without having to change the rules of embryonic development for each of us
    - God has a plan for you and your specific life; the kind of person you are
        - God is responsible for parts of your personality; designed you as a specific individual
    - ? How could that be if God is always on the fly; reworking us in the womb?
        - Preformationism is the answer
        - Allows a space where God could have designed each and one of us in particular detail
        - Without having to get hands dirty at every conception
        - Planned it all in advance
            - It is all set, and it unfolds
- % This is also Malebranche’s theodicy — explanation of why there is suffering
    - ? If God is so omnipotent, compassionate, omniscient, why does life suck so much? Why do innocent people suffer?
    - Answer is based on simple and general laws
        - God did not have enough time to worry about children getting cancer
        - Created these simple and general laws that govern everything
        - A bunch of bad stuff happens on the regular because these were the simplest laws that God could devise that nonetheless ran the universe the way he wanted to

#### Scientific Arguments

- Detflefson:
    - Gives *two* scientific arguments from Malebranche
        1. First is about how hard it looks to explain embryonic development mechanistically
        2. Second about the *structure* of living things in general

#### Scientific Argument 1: Mechanism and Embryos

- % Malebranche loves Descartes
    - Studies his work intensively
    - & But most people agree that Descartes’ attempt to explain embryonic development is a swing and a miss

> [!quote]+ Detlefson p. 142
> “The evidence for mechanism’s inability to account for generation was produced by Descartes when he attempted to provide such an explanation and, many believed, failed abjectly.”

##### Epigenesis

> [!quote]+ Detlefsen, K. (2014). Biology and Theology in Malebranche’s Theory of Organic Generation. In The Life Sciences in Early Modern Philosophy. Oxford University p.142
> “Descartes’s explanation for the phenomenon of organic generation runs roughly as follows: The seminal fluid from the female and male mix in the uterus. They begin a rapid vortical motion due to extreme heat caused by a sort of fermentation upon the mixing, and from this mechanically moving liquid, the heart, then brain, and then other body parts emerge one by one until a living being is formed.”

- All of it mixes together → then warm → then body parts come
- Even at the time, this was regarded as not impressive at all
    - Descartes is kind of all over in his attempts to give a mechanistic explanation of things
- Inertia is a mystery for the straight mechanists
    - Before Newton:
        - ? How does a thing in motion continue to move?
            - Descartes: There are air vortices behind the thing in the air, giving it another push
                - Using vortices all over his physics
                - That’s why he thinks there is a uterine cyclone
                    - Nobody at the time or since thought that this was a particularly-compelling explanation

##### Birthmarks

- Recall Aristotle:
    - Why don’t children resemble the father perfectly?
        - Father offers the form, purpose, efficient cause
        - Mother provides the raw matter
        - Disturbances from the mother
            - Particularly, mother’s imagination
        - % This runs all the way to Descartes
- Descartes:
    - Attributed the existence of birthmarks to the imagination of pregnant mothers
        - e.g., If a pregnant woman sees a fruit and really wants it, that will imprint a fruit-shaped birthmark
- % There is a long tradition that Descartes is drawing from there; not just making it up himself
    - For Aristotle:
        - Stuff about disturbances from mother might explain some parts of why we develop the way we do
        - Main explanation was form and purpose from father’s sperm
    - Descartes’ Explanation
        - & Tries to answer: Why does anyone resembled their parents at all?
            - Epigenesis is just fully inert matter swimming around
            - Influences from mother come to take on a larger role in explaining why we are the way we are
                - & Maternal imagination comes to take on an interesting and substantial role in Descartes’ version of this
- Descartes:
    - Also thought that “female sex organs form if the fetus defecates first, while male organs form if the fetus urinates first”
    - Another sources says Descartes thought that the sex organs always develop towards the mother’s navel (belly button)

> [!summary]+ Scientific Argument 1
> - & Mechanism is bad at explaining embryogenesis
>     - Looks like this intensely, delicate, complicated process, unfolding without anybody else
>     - Looks like the clump of cells is doing it itself
>     - Looks around the world like it is trying to become the baby form of the animal
> - Mechanists do not have any of this machinery available
>     - Cannot invoke form, purposes
>     - Left with “swirly, whirly stuff” as an explanation

- Malebranche says:
    - Maybe God just made us all from the get-go
    - Know mechanism is true about the world
        - Assume that
    - Know that mechanical explanations are bad at explaining embryonic development
        - So maybe just do not explain it at all
    - All form, shape, structure of human body and animals was set by God at the beginning
        - People have much less trouble imagining just matter being added to the already existing form and making it larger
        - We do not know *how* it works, but we could imagine some way that it could work
- Scientific argument 1:
    - ? How can you explain embryonic development mechanistically?
        - & Maybe we don’t
        - & Maybe we just say it is all set in advance by God

#### Scientific Argument 2: Organic Unity and Purposiveness

> [!important] The other scientific argument Malebranche used came from a simple, but profound observation about living things
> - **Organic unity**

> [!note]+ Note the **organic unity** of living things.
> - It looks like somebody made us on purpose
>     - Sometimes, badly
>         - e.g., Wish the air tube and food tube were not so close together
>     - Generally speaking: We look reasonably *well-designed*

- e.g., Cats:
    - Have eyes in the front of their head
        - To better stalk prey
    - Tails provide balance and mobility
    - Claws provide gripping and tearing tools
    - etc.
- & *Unity* is the fitting-together of various features of living animals
    - Looks like all of those features fit together in a really nice way
- Furthermore:
    - Hard to explain how any of these parts work at all without the other parts

> [!info]+ This is describing *final cause* — the *purposes* of things
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/pnHbXwX.png)
> - These are descriptions in terms of the focus of things
>     - Claws are for latching onto things
>     - Long canines are for digging into their jugular
> - & Purposes of the various parts really seem to fit nicely together
>     - There is a *wholeness* and *unity* in living things that is hard to miss when you start looking for it

> [!def]+ Organic unity and purposiveness
> - Standard way today of explaining this apparent design:
>     - Via **natural selection**
>     - % But that is an idea that will not be developed for another century and a half
> - ? So, how to explain the apparent design and unity of the parts of living things?
>     - & Someone must have designed them

##### Epigenesis

- Recall:
    - People also had deep doubts about whether a purely mechanical process could put together something as complex as a living thing
    - & → Not only are we *organized*, but we are organized in a way that looks designed and *intentional*
- Detlefson notes:
    - By themselves, none of these arguments give you **preformationism**
    - Only the whole package of all these things together give you something that moves you towards preformationism
    - Even then, it is a “this-is-more-likely-than-not” style conclusion

##### Mutual Causal Dependence

- Aristotle:
    - Thinks the first thing that you get is a heart
    - Heart is the first thing to live and last to stop when you die
    - The “seed of the soul”
- In Aristotelian picture of embryonic development:
    - Heart comes first
    - Other parts build around that
- Other versions of epigenesis say the spine comes first
    - Then little arms, legs spread out
    - Then head
    - Parts come one after another
- **Epigenesis**
    - & Embryo puts itself together one part at a time
    - ! Malebranche thinks that cannot work

> [!quote]+ Malebranche, quoted in Detlefsen p. 150
> “An organized body contains an infinity of parts that mutually depend upon one another in relation to particular ends, all of which must be actually formed in order to work as a whole. For it need not be imagined with Aristotle that the heart is the first part to live and the last to die. The heart cannot beat without the influence of the animal spirits, nor can these be spread throughout the heart without the nerves, and the nerves originate in the brain, from which they receive the spirits. Moreover, the heart cannot beat and pump the blood through the arteries unless they, as well as the veins that return the blood to it, are already complete.”

- “What good is a heart if you do not have veins or blood?”
    - Or nerves to enervate the heart
    - What are you going to do with just a heart, Aristotle?
- & None of the parts are particularly useful all by themselves
    - None of the parts work without all of the other parts
- & This is an argument against epigenesis
    - % Also, epigenesis is hard to explain mechanistically
        - Not only have we got organic unity at a time, but somehow, have to go from clump of cells and at every stage, be viable as a living thing
            - And go from being clump of cells to being an adult
                - Being viable at every moment
                - Having an ever-changing organic unity when every part depends on every other part for its very existence
            - % Malebranche thinks: You are not going to get this putting it one part at a time (epigenesis) and get it mechanistically

> [!note]+ Good argument for…
> - Aristotle probably got the wrong picture
>     - One part at a time does not really make sense because all parts depend on each other for their goals and purposes
>     - Malebranche has the language of final causes (of purposes and particular ends) here
>         - % Even as a mechanist, he is allowed to use this language that Descartes tries to avoid in his description of the body
>             - Because Malebranche thinks this is designed by God
>             - There are ends in God’s hands
> - A mechanist is allowed to say: “I had a plan, then I built the thing according to my plan, and my plan is for this purpose”
> - Mechanists are fine if there is a plan involved that has the plan and goals
>     - The world itself is not supposed to have those things
>     - Just us humans

#### An “All Things Considered” Argument

> [!important]+ Detlefsen notes that none of these arguments, by themselves, are all that compelling
> - To get to preformationism:
>     - & Need each of them working together
> - Even then:
>     - You do not get anything like a proof
>     - Just that it looks likelier than not (if that)

#### Microscopy

- One would think that the introduction of *microscopes* would solve this debate easily (surrounding preformationism)
    - ! But some of the first microscopists reported seeing *tiny little people* in sperm
        - Top right

## Life and Mechanism

- ? When did scientific consensus move towards there being basic physical and chemical explanations for all living processes?
    - Mid 1800s
    - Malebranche is 1600-1700
- Preformationism does not survive the invention of *good* microscopes
    - Once they got to the level where you could see detail in something like sperm
    - No more little people in there
    - ! But a number of ideas of living things do survive that
- **Vitalism**
    - Idea that there are special physical forces that apply only to living things
    - A serious scientific hypothesis well into the 1800s

![](https://i.imgur.com/7kac0Bh.png)
*Synthesis of Urea (on the right)*

- **==Wohler==**
    - Synthesized Urea from inorganic reagents
        - In the sense of not from life
    - Showing that similar chemical principles apply to life as the rest of the world
- % Before this, it was a plausible hypothesis that chemical processes in life were simply impossible to achieve without a living thing
    - e.g., Urea are a product of living metabolic process
        - Urea was a relatively simple molecule
            - But was regarded as a kind of thing only life could produce
            - Wohler synthesizes this that does not come from life
            - → Could make organic molecoles (not carbon-bearing, but in the sense that life can produce) out of non-life
            - No hard wall between the chemistry of living and non-living things
                - & Argument: It is the same chemistry
- % This was popularly taken to be the end of *vitalism*
    - But that exaggerates the actual historical impact
    - Was one part of the story of the unraveling of the idea that there was anything in physics or chemistry that is different in life and non-life

<!-- break -->
- **==Helmhotlz==**
    - Experiments on heat generation in organic tissue
- Establishes the first law of thermodynamics: conservation of energy
    - Provided strong evidence that heat produced by living things was just the same in quantity and type as heat from any other chemical reactions
