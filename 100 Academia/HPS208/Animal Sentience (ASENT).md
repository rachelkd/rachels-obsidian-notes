# Animal Sentience

> [!abstract]+ We look at the question of animal sentience, particularly as it relates to ==animal welfare policy==
> - Reading (Browning & Birch, 2022) surveys the ==state of several connected connections on these topics==
>     - ? What kind of rules and policies should a nation have in place to protect the welfare of animals, and *which* animals/living things need types of protection?
> - Produced as part of the ASENT Project, which looked at various aspects of animal sentience from science, philosophy, and policy angles
>     - Not really driving towards one specific thesis; trying to give you basic overview of ASENT

> [!def]+ Sentience
> - Broad definition:
>     - Means there is ==something that it is like to be== that thing
>     - Has a perspective or other
> - Narrow definition:
>     - A creature is ==capable of positive and negative experiences==
>         - e.g., Can be happy, sad, suffering, pain, joy, etc.

- Some — particularly in philosophy of mind literature — argue:
    - Broad and narrow definitions end up “picking at” the same thing in the world
    - If there’s something that it’s like to be you, then it has to be the case that you have positive and negative experiences
    - Browning and Birch agree:
        - If you have joy, fear, pain, etc., there must be something it’s like to be you

> [!note]+ Browning and Birch are *not* trying to have a conversation about consciousness in this article
> - Not trying to do consciousness
> - The **affects** — positive and negative experiences — that harm or help the being themselves

## Sentience and Moral Questions

- Positive and negative affect is deeply tied to the policy questions
- If something does not experience real joy or fear, then you do not really care about it
    - e.g., Could easily imagine a robot that is programmed to display pain behaviour
        - Avoidance, crying out, etc.
        - Assume robot is not **sentient**:
            - & There is a sense in which we do not really care about the robot’s supposed pain, because it does not really care
        - It is not pain, fear, or sadness behaviours that we care about
        - If robot does not care about its own feelings → You don’t care about its feelings
        - Feelings should not matter policy-wise

> [!example]+ Consider the case of a human being who is exposed to pain they do not care about at all.
> - e.g., You can tell that you are having surgery done on you, but you do not care whatsoever because you are under anaesthesia
> - & There is a sense in which that person is not suffering
> - Similarly, imagine a normally positive feeling which a person has no emotional reaction to:
>     - In a sense, their happiness is not increased by it

> [!note]- Personal thought…
> - We can only feel positive feelings in comparison to negative feelings and vice versa
> - If you go about your life only feeling positive experiences, then there is no such thing as positive

> [!note]+ Terminology for this week; distinguishing pain and suffering
> - **Pain** is when your pain receptors are firing
>     - You can tell something noxious or damaging is happening to your body
> - **Suffering** is when you care about it
>     - e.g., When you are sad because you are in pain

> [!attention]+ Argument: Pain without suffering is not *morally relevant*.
> - Do not care if something is in **pain**
> - & Care that it is **suffering**
> - e.g., If you have an anaesthetic and you can tell that you are in pain, but you have no concern about it whatsoever, that is fine, morally speaking
>     - Similarly, if you experience pleasure and it does nothing for you — you are no happier with having experienced this pleasure — that is no better than not experiencing the pleasure

- & What distinguishes the mere firing of pain receptions from **suffering** is then the integration of pain into a larger system of emotion and cognition
- & Suffering in this sense is a ==condition of the whole organism==

## Pain vs. Suffering

> “The Blessed One said, “When touched with a feeling of pain, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person sorrows, grieves, & laments, beats his breast, becomes distraught. So ==he feels two pains, physical & mental==. Just as if they were to shoot a man with an arrow and, right afterward, were to shoot him with another one, so that he would feel the pains of two arrows, in the same way, when touched with a feeling of pain, the uninstructed run-of-the mill person sorrows, grieves, & laments, beats his breast, becomes distraught. So he feels two pains, physical & mental.”
>
> The Arrow Sallattha Sutta (SN 36:6)

- If you are a well tutored student of Dharma:
    - You can feel pain, but
    - Not have the second round of suffering
    - Buddhist thought of **perfected state**
        - When you have yourself in a perfect moral, psychological state
        - You still feel pain, but you do not suffer from it
        - You still feel pleasure, but you do not get enthralled in it
- Thinking about policy, what we need to do to take care of living things:
    - It is the suffering that matters
    - Inflicting pain does not matter too much
- ? For things that cannot communicate with us, how do we tell if they are suffering?
    - Proposal: Maybe the pain is the object of thing you can actually measure, by measuring the firing of sensory neurons
        - Suffering is the subject of thing
    - Another proposal: Maybe we can measure stress responses? A secondary proxy indicator of what “suffering” looks like
        - Counterargument: You can have different interpretations of stress responses
        - e.g., Body is flooded by norepinephrine (adrenaline) for many reasons

## Which Animals Are Sentient?

- % We mostly focus on *suffering*, because that is what public policy should be focused on
    - We use terms **pleasure** and **joy** in place for pain and suffering respectively

> [!question] If sentience is what matters in deciding which animals get legal protections, how do we decide which animals are sentient?

> [!question] How do we even begin working out what the criteria for sentience are?

- You might care about animals or plants or living things for prudential reasons:
    - i.e., You probably should not burn down every forest in the world even if you come to the conclusion that trees do not have feelings
        - Do not burn down all the trees because we need them to live, but
        - Not for the sake of the trees, but for humans more so

### Criteria of Sentience

- Consider what sentience could look like from a neurological standpoint
- One possible topics for [[Critical Response|critical response]] is to pick one or small set of criteria
    - Explain why it should be modified in some ways
    - Maybe not necessary; maybe needs to be stronger
    - Policy paper; recommendations for changes in animal law specifically in the UK
- **Cephalopods**
    - Include octopuses, among other species
- **Decapods**
    - Include lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, among others
- There are few people saying that single-cell organisms are sentient; few saying dogs and cats are not sentient
    - Cephalopods and decapods bring in a controversial lens
    - In the middle of biological complexity

> [!summary]+ Proposed criteria (for policy making)
> **Neurological criteria**:
>
> 1. Possession of nociceptors i.e., pain receptions
> 2. Possession of integrative brain regions
> 3. Connections between nociceptors and integrative brain regions
>
> **Behavioural criteria**:
>
> 4. Responses affected by potential local anaesthetics or analgesics i.e., painkillers
> 5. Motivational trade-offs that show a balancing of threat against opportunity for reward
> 6. Flexible self-protective behaviours in response to injury and threat
> 7. Associative learning that goes beyond habituation and sensitization
> 8. Behaviour that shows the animal values local anaesthetics or analgesics when injured

^648b51

#### Neurological Criteria

Criteria 1. to 3.

- **Nociceptor**
    - Sensory neuron that response to damage or injury
- e.g., If you put a single cell flowing organism in a gradient where one half of the tank is toxic, it will swim away from the toxic stuff
    - → Sensing this as toxic and moving away from it
    - 1. seems straightforward to meet
- **Integrative brain regions** is less easy to match

##### Integrative Brain Regions

- **Integrative brain regions**
    - Connect various parts of the nervous system and coordinate the overall behaviour of the organism

> [!question]+ Why should it matter whether the nociceptors connect to integrative brain regions?
> - Something that integrates the pain into suffering

##### Behaviour vs. Reflexes

- Part of the justification for requiring integrated brain regions as part of behavioural loop is to ==exclude mere reflexes==
    - Can have behaviours that look like pain behaviours or attempts to do something that you want to do to get rid of pain
    - e.g., Can still get some reflexes to fire after an animal is dead
        - Twitch responses from animals when dead by sending electricity through body
        - Can cut snakes head and it will bite its own body
- If something is dead and can have reflexes:
    - Dead things are not presumably sentient
    - & → Reflexes are not enough of a sign of sentience to be something we base our decisions on
- While we can suffer as a consequence of a reflex response:
    - e.g., Putting hand on stove → Reflex before pain registers
    - & Reflex itself does not seem to imply sentience

> [!important]+ Meeting one criteria does not conclude that an animal is sentience, but ==lacking== one is a *disqualifier*

#### 4. Responses Affected by Potential Local Anaesthetics or Analgesics

- Criterion is a modification of a previous set developed by Smith and Boyd (1991):

    > “Receptors for opioid substances found in the central nervous system, especially the brain.”

- Idea:
    - & Behavioural cues should show that the organism cares about their own pain
        - In both cases
    - i.e., If your brain has a way of dialling up and down the pain responses
    - → Shows that something is integrated
        - More than just pain
        - There is some level of suffering that should be turned up and down

#### 5. Motivational Trade-offs that Show a Balancing of Threat against Opportunity for Reward

- Browning and Birch example:
    - Hermit crabs who will resist leaving a shell despite mild electric shocks
    - Only if it is a particularly nice shell
- & → More behavioural evidence that pain is being *integrated* into a more complex picture of things
    - “I care about this pain, but I care more about this shell; I really like it”
    - Neurological integration is a physical fact
    - This is a behavioural fact that goes with it

#### 6. Flexible Self-Protective Behaviours in Response to Injury and Threat

- Evidence that the organism cares about its safety and wellbeing
- *Flexible*
    - Mere reflexes do not count
        - e.g., If you put your hand on a hot stove and pull it away, you are just going to do it
        - Behaviour is not flexible
    - Has to look — in some sense — goal-directed
    - Response has to look smart
    - Has to be based on the context
    - Have to have a range of possible behaviours, and
    - Select the one that is appropriate for that context
    - A behavioural marker of integration of “having a world”

#### 7. Associative Learning that Goes Beyond Habituation and Sensitization

- **Habituation**
    - When a response to a stimuli simply decreases over time
    - Sensitization is the opposite
        - Response to stimuli is a little larger each time
- **Associative learning**
    - Making novel connections between stimuli, and
    - Organizing new behaviours around those connections
    - e.g., Make a sound → Dog does not drool → Combine sound with food (conditioning) → Dog drools when it hears the sound
    - i.e., Any two features of your experience can be integrated together
        - Can have arbitrary connections between thing
    - Indicates that the organism is understanding the world around them

> [!attention]+ Browning and Birch: Habituation and sensitization are not good criteria for sentience
> - Can see those responses in organisms with no central nervous system
>     - e.g., Jellyfish

#### 8. Behaviour that Shows the Animal Values Local Anaesthetics or Analgesics when Injured

- Integrates some of the previous criteria
- Shows that organism *cares* about its own pain, because it is responding to painkillers
    - Giving organisms the option to self-administer
        - e.g., Food or painkillers
- Also shows flexible behaviour, balancing motivational trade-offs

### Who Passes the Test?

- ! Criteria is not meant as either/or questions
    - None is necessary or sufficient for passing

![|415](https://i.imgur.com/B3Ab8Ra.png)

- Birch et al. rate various species from very low to very high confidence on each

### Insects

> [!summary]+ Browning and Birch report that the evidence for sentience in insects is ==mixed==.
>
> > “Insects will continue normal feed and mating behaviours even when severely injured” (Eisemann et al., 1984)

- Recalls Heidegger’s example in his *Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics*
    - Meant to show insects are “poor of world”
- e.g., A bee with an incision in its abdomen will continue to eat honey indefinitely while it flows out the hold

## No Cortex No Cry

![](https://i.imgur.com/tDAcnqz.png)

- Key (2016)
    - Argues that likely fish do not feel pain
- Humans: Can compare self-reports of pain with brain scans
    - Pattern of activity which correlates with experienced pain happen in the **neocortex**
        - Both humans and mice
- Fish do not have the neocortex

### Multiple Realizability

> [!attention]+ Reply from critics of the “No Cortex No Cry” view
> - There is no reason to believe that any given function could not be realized in multiple different ways biologically

- Octopuses last had common ancestor with humans more than 500 million years ago
    - Radically different neural anatomy
    - Yet can problem solve in ways analogous to humans, communicate, etc.

> [!question] If intelligence is multiply realizable, why not suffering and joy?

### But How Multiply?

- Browning and Birch point out:
    - Single celled organisms e.g., paramecia do things like avoid noxious substances and other dangers, as well as approach food
- In humans:
    - Would interpret this as evidence of feelings
    - ? But is this too far?
- When you put on hand sanitizer and kill paramecia, you might argue that it is fine because they do not have a nervous system, but
    - Multiple realizability argues unconstrained says: ==Who knows the ways in which suffering is realized?==

## What a Real Answer Looks Like?

- Ultimately, answer to these questions should take the form of a ==scientific theory of sentience==
- If we had a full theory of how sentience is realized biologically across species:
    - Conversation would be done
- But pretty far away from that point now

### Some Theoretical Leads

- Set aside the most abstract questions about conscious experience
    - Qualia, etc.
    - Sentience has some leads vs. studying consciousness
- Some researchers who think we can make incremental progress on questions about what sentience is ==for biologically==
    - → Ask the functional questions

> [!question]+ What does sentience give you? What is it for? What advances does it give you biologically? Why did it evolve? What benefit does it provide?
> - If we can answer that, maybe we can determine when it evolved, and where

#### Multisensory Maps

- Feinberg and Mallatt (2019)
    - Propose that conscious experience plays a role in organizing and synthesizing different streams of sensory information
    - A **unified simulation** of reality ==provides organisms with a sense of what is important, and its behavioural options== in novel situations
- If you treat sentience that way
    - Can see where it arose in evolutionary history
    - Single cell organisms do not have the machinery to build a simulation of reality
        - Have the ability to respond to immediate responsive stimuli, maybe (associative) learning
        - But not enough machinery inside to build up a model of what is happening around it
    - Nervous systems are probably around when it starts to emerge
- A gradual development of more and more sentience as you develop a more and more sophisticated world model
    - Aligns nicely with **Global Workspace Model**
        - What you are experiencing is your brain’s best guess at what is going on around you
        - You do not experience the world;
        - You experience the world model
        - Brain does that because it wants to gleam the benefits of **parallel processing** and having a unified processor
            - e.g., Can be reading a book, but part of your brain is simultaneously monitoring the sense of smell so you can tell when the bacon is burning
        - Does not break into conscious experience until it rises to a certain threshold

### Precautionary Reasoning

- Browning and Birch suggest **precautionary reasoning**
    - Being careful in the face of uncertainty
- Rough formulation:
    - Should assume sentience until we have evidence of its absence

> [!important] Details matter a lot here!

#### Precautionary Principles

- **Precautionary principles**
    - Widely cited in policy making in things that are especially life or death
        - e.g., Environmental law
- Suppose there is 10% chance that a given technology wipes out humanity in 10 years
    - Not sure, but might
    - Precautionary principle says:
        - You probably should not do that
    - Cannot say “who knows?”
        - Risk is so severe, that you probably should not do it

> [!info] Precautionary Principle
> - Strongest version of the principle:
>     - & Act as though the harm exists until you are sure it does not
> - Weaker version:
>     - Prevention of harm should be prioritized under uncertainty, but
>     - With a ==view to the cost==

> [!example]+ Consider the possibility that insects are sentient, combined with the fact that huge numbers are killed because of agriculture.
> - ? Do we stop farming?
>     - Strongest says: Stop farming
>         - This is not going to get by parliament
>     - Weaker: Look at the degree of ==certainty== and ==uncertainty==, and the ==harms== on either side

> [!attention] Argument: There is a decent change that cephalopods and decapods are sentient
> - We should probably care about their feelings
> - Cost of suffering created in the world is massive if we continue with same practices
> - Cost of acting as though they are sentient until we figure out if they actually are is relatively low

- % Just because you have moral obligation towards being → Does not mean their POV overrides everything
    - e.g., Can go on Internet and be mean to (sentient) people
    - e.g., Don’t have to go: “Single ant will be harmed, so I will starve to death”
        - Can prioritize your own wellbeing over that ant
- But, if you had a choice to pay $20 vs. $25 for more ethically-sourced crab
    - Precautionary principle (even in weaker version) says: You should pay more for the ethically-sourced crab

## Legal Changes

- ASENT did something:
    - UK recently expanded scope of their laws on animal protection
    - At least partly due to ASENT report
- Animal Welfare (Sentience) bill:
    - Expanded to include cephalopod molluscs and decapod crustaceans

### Animal Welfare Laws in Canada

- Under federal law in Canada:
    - Animals are considered ==property==
    - Illegal to cause “unnecessary pain, suffering, or injury to an animal or a bird”
    - Law does not specify what counts as “necessary”
        - “I want to eat that thing” is often sufficient justification to kill it
        - Sometimes, animal is treated really, really poorly as well
- Some categories of animals get additional protection
    - e.g., Service animals
- Animal fighting, bestiality is illegal
- Wild animals have much fewer protections than ones protected as property
- BC amended family law legislation to include pets as members of the family rather than mere possessions
    - e.g., In divorce cases
    - Early 2024
- Federal ban on cosmetic testing on animals
    - Late 2023
- Discussions are taking place about ==banning== the ==captivity== of elephants and great apes
    - Same way captivity of cetaceans was banned in 2019

#### Who Are the Animals?

- Canadian animal welfare laws do not define “animal”
- Term seems to be taken to be obvious in extent
- If we take animal to be equivalent to kingdom animalia
    - → Microscopic insects to blue whales count

## Key Terms

### ASENT

- ASENT refers to the Animal Sentience project, which explores animal sentience from scientific, philosophical, and policy lenses.
- ASENT aims to synthesize empirical data from scientific findings with ethical and legal questions about how societies should treat animals.
- The project defines sentience as the capacity for any type of subjective experience, where there is something it is like to be that animal. In a narrower sense, sentience refers to the capacity to have subjective experiences with positive and negative valence, such as pain, pleasure, anxiety, and joy.
- ASENT frames suffering as morally relevant in the context of animal welfare. Suffering is defined as the experience of caring about pain, as opposed to simply registering pain. Browning and Birch argue that pain without suffering disqualifies an animal from sentience.
- Additionally, the project proposes both neurological and behavioural criteria for determining which animals are sentient. These include the presence of nociceptors, integrative brain regions, responses to pain killers, and motivational trade-offs.

### No Cortex No Cry

- The No Cortex No Cry argument asserts that only organisms with a neocortex can experience conscious pain or suffering.
- Furthermore, since fish and invertebrates lack a neocortex, they cannot feel pain.
- This argument draws on observations in humans where pain experience is strongly associated with activity in the neocortex. The pattern of brain activity correlating with experienced pain in humans also occurs in mice, and both species have a neocortex.
- Critics of this argument appeal to multiple realizability, which argues that suffering and other subjective experiences might be generated by multiple biological mechanisms. Therefore, the lack of a neocortex does not necessarily mean that an animal cannot feel pain.
- However, single-celled organisms e.g., paramecia exhibit behaviour that potentially meet ASENT’s criteria for sentience, such as avoid noxious substances and other dangers. Multiple realizability argues that the lack of a neocortex (and nervous system) in paramecia does not mean that it does not suffer when it is killed. Then, even the act of rubbing hand sanitizer becomes morally relevant.

### Sentience

- Sentience is a concept with significant implications for animal ethics and animal welfare science and policy.
- In a broad sense, sentience is defined as the capacity for any type of subjective experience or phenomenal consciousness. It refers to the idea that there is something it is like to be that being, implying there is a subjective quality to a sentient being’s experience.
- In a narrower sense, Browning and Birch define sentience as the capacity to have subjective experiences with a positive or negative valence. These experiences include feelings such as pain, pleasure, anxiety, or joy. While experiences can involve a mix of sensory, affective, and cognitive components, it is the affective part that makes experiences feel good or bad.
- Some argue that both definitions of sentience refer to the same thing: if there is something it is like to be a being, then that being must have the capacity for positive and negative experiences. Similarly, if a being has feelings like joy, fear, or pain, then there must be something it is like to be that being.
- Browning and Birch describe neurological and behavioural criteria for determining sentience. However, meeting one criterion does not conclude that an animal is sentient, but lacking one is a disqualifier.
- Sentience is an important factor in discussions about animal welfare. The focus is on sentience because it is the experience of suffering that should matter, not just the firing of pain receptors. Browning and Birc argue that pain without suffering is not morally relevant.
- As the determination of sentience is so complex, precautionary reasoning is important when considering animal welfare in the face of uncertainty. That is to assume sentience until there is evidence to the contrary, while also balancing the costs and benefits of this approach.

### Multisensory Maps

- Multisensory maps are a theoretical concept proposed by Feinberg and Mallatt as a way to understand the biological function of conscious experience.
- The idea is that conscious experience plays a role in organizing and synthesizing different streams of sensory information.
    - Conscious experience creates a unified simulation of reality for an organism. This simulation integrates various sensory inputs, allowing the organism to make sense of its environment and its place within it. Additionally, it provides the organism with a sense of what is important and helps it determine its behavioural options in novel situations.
- By viewing sentience through the lens of multisensory maps, it becomes possible to explore where sentience arose in evolutionary history.
    - For example, single-celled organisms lack the machinery to build such a simulation and only have the ability to respond to immediate stimuli or maybe do some associative learning.
    - Then, nervous systems are likely a necessary component for the emergence of this kind of unified simulation.
    - Sentience can then be seen as a gradual development, with more sophisticated world models corresponding to more advanced forms of sentience.

## Tutorial Notes

- *Natural Wonders* by Edwin Tenney Brewster
    - We consider blood in a human to be alive, but the same blood could be rendered dead (outside of a body?)
- **Sentience**
    - Capacity to have feelings
        - Pain, pleasure, hunger, thirst, warmth, joy, comfort, excitement, etc.
    - Not simply the capacity to feel pain, but feelings of pain, distress or harm
        - Have a special significance for animal welfare law
- **ASENT Project**
    - Project led by researchers at London School of Economics to study animal sentience
    - Application to animal welfare:
        - UK recently expanded scope of their laws on animal protection to include cephalopods and octopods
            - (Due to the ASENT report)
- **Multisensory maps**
    - Another way to think about sentience
    - Sentience as a **unified simulation** of what is most important in a given situation
        - What you experience is your brain’s best guess of what is going on around you
    - After you have a nervous system, the further along you progress in complexity as a multicellular organism:
        - You gradually develop sentience
    - Suggests that consciousness (and sentience) is developed evolutionary
        - ? Then, why is consciousness or sentience evolutionarily beneficial?
            - i.e., Why would we want to evolve to have consciousness or sentience
            - Maybe problem-solving?
- **No Cortex No Cry**
    - Key (2016) argues that fish likely do not *feel* pain
    - In humans:
        - Can compare self-reports of pain with brain scans
        - → Can see that the sensation of pain is correlated to activity in neocortex
            - Similarly happens in the cortex of mice
    - But fish do not share this neural structure
        - Therefore, fish don’t feel pain
- **Multiple realizability**
    - ==Counterargument== for “No Cortex No Cry”
    - Can’t the ability to feel and care about your own pain be realized in different ways?
    - Octopuses last had a common ancestor with humans more than 500 million years ago, with radically different neural anatomy
        - Yet they can problem solve in ways analogous to humans, communicate, etc.
    - If intelligence is multiply realizable, why not suffering and joy?

> [!idea]+ Then, what is okay to eat?
> - Fish, octopus?
