# Critical Response

## Tutorial

Summarize one of the following debates, and provide your own original argument for it.

1. The ASENT project developed a set of criteria for sentience. Choose one for a small interconnected set of these criteria and provide some reasons why it should be modified. Then, suggest a modification that would solve the issues you have identified.
2. & Suppose it is shown that plants can perceive, learn and problem solve. Provide an argument for a view of what that would mean for our ethical obligations towards plants.
3. Provide an argument for or against the idea that we can meaningfully apply behavioural science to living things without nervous systems.

## Ideas

Suppose it is shown that plants can perceive, learn and problem solve. Provide an argument for a view of what that would mean for our ethical obligations towards plants.

- Can believe that plants have consciousness or sentience without “extreme” ethical obligations towards plants
- Jainism: Low level of sensory experiences
- Anishinaabe:
    - Pay respects to plants to be able to use them
- Juxtaposed to Hinduism:
    - There are ways to ethically consume meat and kill animals
    - These reasons are prudential and anthropocentric, but does it really matter?
    - You are paying respect to the animals
- Find research of how Indigenous peoples view death as a transformation potentially?
    - Inspiration from Eden Robinson’s *Monkey Beach*
    - The death of the body is not the death of the spirit
- The Last Man Argument
    - Aligns with the Indigenous/Anishinaabe view that we live in harmony with the spirits, plants, animals
    - Interconnectedness
        - Attributes a moral responsibility to care for, live in harmony with, and respect the natural world
    - “all parts of Nature have an intrinsic value; as such, all of Nature should be treated with dignity, kindness, and righteousness” Framarin
        - Aligns with Anishinaabe practices
    - Hinduism and Anishinaabe principles differ in that just because plants and animals have intrinsic value does not entail that they must not be killed for anthropocentric, prudential reasons
- If plants are shown to possess the capacities to perceive, learn, and problem-solve, then our ethical obligations towards them must shift from mere preservation to active respect and consideration of their needs and interests, necessitating a framework that recognizes their agency and incorporates reciprocal relationships inspired by traditions such as the Anishinaabeg.
- This approach suggests that the moral permissibility of using plants and animals depends not on a strict prohibition against killing but on the intention, method, and context of the interaction.
- Interconnectedness:
    - Framarin objects
    - Then, it follows that another framework must attribute direct moral standing to plants.
        - Anishinaabe principles

Conclusion:

- Framarin’s conclusion:
    - Hinduism provides a plausible environmental ethic because it attributes sentience across the living world, and it is simply just bad to harm sentient beings
    - Then, it follows that we do not need to have evidence for plant cognition in order to attribute direct moral standing to it
    - This is a principle that a non-Hindu person could also give
- Similarly, one does not have to subscribe to Anishinaabeg philosophy to believe that humans must treat plants with care and humble respect
    - Intuitively, from the Last Man argument, there is a moral implication to live in harmony and not destroy
- Then, simply put, the principle of doing no harm also applies to plants and thus we have a moral obligation to consider the wellbeing of plants.
