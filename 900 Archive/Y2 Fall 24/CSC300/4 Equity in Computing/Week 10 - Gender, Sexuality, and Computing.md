# Feminism as a Social Theory, Not a “Political Ideology”

- Feminism has recently been cast as a “political ideology”
    - Massive oversimplification, which
        - Fails to understand the multiple theoretical, analytical, conceptual, practical, and applied dimensions in a long history of serious intellectual work
- We understand **feminism** as an intellectual and social concern with equity, and
    - A recognition of the existence of inequity

> [!important] Feminism is not just for women, and it is not anti-men.

- Feminism, as a social and political theory should be understood as a toolkit for ==improving social relationships==
    - Not as a framework for increasing conflict between groups

# Gender and Sex

- Historically, the terms *sex* and *gender* have been used interchangeably, but
    - Their uses are becoming increasingly distinct
    - Important to understand the differences between the two
- **Sex**
    - Refers to the biological characteristics that define humans as female or male
    - Tend to differentiate humans as humans and females, although
        - These sets of biological characteristics are not mutually exclusive
            - There are individuals who possess both sexes
- **Gender**
    - ==Socially constructed== characteristics of women and men
        - e.g., Norms, roles, relationships of and between groups of women and men
    - Varies from society to society and can be changed

> [!important] Gender roles and gender stereotypes are highly fluid and can shift substantially over time

> [!example]+ Who wears the high heels?
> - High heels are now considered feminine throughout much of the world, but
> - Initially designed for upper-class men for hunting
> - Over time, the perception of high heels gradually became feminine, but
>     - Nothing intrinsically feminine about the shoe
> - Social norms have just made it so

# Gender is …

- **Socially constructed**
    - Social role of a woman (or for that matter “man”) comes from a ==collection of behaviours into which we are socialized==
        - Different fields (e.g., science, biology, psychoanalysis) are used as different theories for explaining the female condition
        - None of these theories fully explain the every aspect of a woman’s situation
            - e.g., Biology cannot account for the ways in which society conditions people to treat one another
            - Psychoanalysis really ignores the question of why people are driven by certain motivations to begin with
            - Historical materialism is too fixated on the economic theories to recognize how sexuality and other factors play into men’s treatment of women
    - No one is born a woman; it is something you *become*
        - Simone de Beauvoir: “The Second Sex”
    - Rather than a biological category, it is a ==creation of history, religion, and myths==, which are
        - Constantly ==reproduced by male-dominated social forces==
    - For the female to become free,
        - Need to understand that woman is nothing more than a **social construct**
- **Performative**
    - Judith Butler
    - Gender identity is a *performative accomplishment* compelled by *social sanction* and *taboo*
        - Agrees with de Beauvoir: Gender is not something you are born with; it is something that you become
        - You perform to become your gender
    - You do not have gender first, then choose to perform it
    - Rather, gender is ==created by the act of your performance==
    - Performance is informed by what is already ==historically constituted as gender== and is performed by the individual through *acts of the body*
        - i.e., We are always under the duress to give the gendered performance that is expected from us
    - Because gender identity is constructed through acts, there exists a possibility to construct a different gender by any other act
        - There are restrictions that we have
        - Discouraged from playing in this space by social expectations and taboos
        - The limit are assigned gender spaces
        - Any act that deviates from socially-intended gender is subjected to punishment

# Sexism and Misogyny

- **Sexism**
    - Defined as an economic, political, and social discrimination against women based on the belief that the male sex is *superior* to the female sex
    - Requires hyperfocus on the perceived differences between the two sexes
        - Includes stereotyping based on a preconception of gender norms
        - Demands that people be primed to identify with the gendered expectations of their sex
    - Pushes that people should be primed to identify with the expectations that are there from their sex
- **Misogyny**
    - When you act upon sexism
    - Contempt for women, specifically for those who do not adhere to the status quo, who challenge the male dominance
    - Involves punishment of these women
        - Through words, actions, sometimes violence

> [!important]+ Not all sexists are misogynists
> - Can believe that women are fragile creatives just waiting to experience the joy of motherhood
>     - *Sexism*
> - Without being hostile towards women
>     - *Misogynistic*
> - & But, all misogynists are sexists

# What is Wrong with These Current Designs?

- ? Why do we need to care about gender and computing

> [!example]+ Apple HealthKit
> - Enabled specialized tracking, such as selenium and copper intake, but
> - Neglected to include a women’s period tracker until iOS 9
> - If you come up with a sophisticated software like Apple HealthKit, implementing a period tracker should not been much of a hassle in terms of technical issues
>     - Shows that it was not really a priority for the developers and designers up until iOS 9

- The priorities and the intentions of the designers
    - How negligent designers can be towards certain populations
    - Want to avoid this in the next generation of developers and entrepreneurs
        - When you develop a piece of software, you are responsible for thinking about your entire audience — all the people that are going to be using your product
        - Think inclusively, because the features you implement matter

> [!example]+ Fitness Applications
> - Failed to have adjustments for pregnant and breastfeeding women
> - Smart scales should accommodate women who are expecting
> - Sleep trackers should not chastise new moms for not getting enough rest
> - One user suggested “Stroller mode” for tracking exercise
>     - Suggesting that the amount of work it takes to push a stroller should be accounted

> [!example]+ Stanford Gaydar Machine
> - Example of a disturbing technology-fueled revival of **physiognomy**
>     - Long discredited notion that personality traits can be revealed y measuring the size and shape of a person’s eyes, nose, and face
> - Disturbing to see what some of the brightest minds are working on
>     - What is their research actually contributing to the world?
> - Also threatens the privacy of LGBTQ’s lives
>     - & Thinking about the aftermath of research or software development also matters

> [!example]+ Microsoft Tay.ai
> - 2016
> - Microsoft launched a teenage chatbot that learned from interactions
> - Within 24 hours of being exposed to public, Tay took on a ==racist, sexist, homophobic== personality
> - Had to be taken down indefinitely
>     - Does not exist anymore

> [!example]+ Voice recognition software
> - Tends to hear the male voices more easily than the female ones
> - Reason behind isn’t the biological differences between women and men or a hardware issue
> - All about the data that these applications are being trained on
>     - Data is male-dominated
>     - Application had a harder time recognizing female voices
> - This can range from non-critical applications to critical applications
>     - e.g., Doctor uses voice recognition software to take notes
>     - Can think of the potential outcomes that can happen

> [!example]+ Smart home technology
> - Misuse of smart home technology by past partners of women
> - Can be turned into a tool for domestic abuse
> - As most digital devices are installed by men, it is former partners (not hackers) who pose the greatest threat to women’s welfare
>     - e.g., Fiddling around with smart home devices when ex-partners no longer live in that home
> - Analogy:
>     - A knife can be used to cut and harm. The problem is not the knife, it is the person who is using it
>     - Difference here is that smart home technologies have people behind them
>         - e.g., Designer, software developer
>     - & Part of their responsibility to think about all the outcomes their product might have
>         - Including how their product might be misused

> [!example]+ First all-women space walk
> - Spacesuit design choices delayed the first all-female spacewalk
>     - The problem was *not* about the differences in male and female physiques
>     - Nothing inherently wrong with women’s bodies; it was purely a design choice
> - Designers did not account for the differences between men and women’s bodies when designing the space suit
> - Only took about 54 years to achieve this

> [!example]+ Room temperature
> - Standard room temperature was actually devised based on men’s physiques
> - Women’s bodies require a more dynamic temperature change throughout the day vs. men’s, which is more constant and less dynamic
> - When the community was deciding on a standard office temperature, they decided based on men’s room temperature

> [!example]+ Crash test bias
> - Male-focused testing is putting female drivers at risk
> - Dummies for testing are not made based on a realistic image of women’s bodies

# Women in the History of Computing: Selected Key Figures

## Pre 1900

- Ada Lovelace
    - **First computer programmer**
    - First person to publish an algorithm intended to be executed by the first modern computer, the **Analytical Engine**
    - Created several proofs to show how the engine would handle calculations of Bernoulli Numbers on its own
    - Proofs are consider the ==first examples of a computer program==

## 1940-

- **Kilogirl**
    - Tedious computing and calculating was seen as “women’s work” through the 1940s
    - Resulting in the term *kilogirl*
        - Invented by a member of Applied Mathematics Panel in the early 1940s
    - A kilogirl of energy was “equivalent to roughly a thousand hours of computing labour”
    - NACA recognized in 1942 that engineers admit themselves that “the girl computers do the work more rapidly and accurately than they could”
- **Hedy Lamarr** and co-inventor, George Antheil
    - Worked on a ==frequency hopping method== to help the Navy control torpedoes remotely
    - Navy passed on their idea, but Lamarr and Antheil received a patent for their work on August 11, 1942
    - Technique would later be used again in 1950s at Sylvania Electronic Systems Division
        - Also used in everyday technology such as ==Bluetooth== and ==Wi-Fi==
- **ENIAC girls**
    - Programmers of the ENIAC computer in 1944 were 6 female mathematicians
        - Computers at the time involved moving switches
    - Were human computers at the Moore School’s computation lab
- **Grace Hopper**
    - First person to create a *compiler* for a programming language
    - One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer
        - Electro-mechanical computer based on the Analytical Engine
    - Hopper programmer computer and created a 500-page comprehensive manual for it
    - Coined the term *bug* and *debugging*
        - Discovered a moth that caused Mark II to malfunction

## 1970s

- **Adele Goldberg**
    - One of the seven programmers that developed *Smalltalk* in 1970s
        - One of the first object-oriented programming  languages
        - Bases of the current GUIs that we use today
    - Wrote the majority of the language’s documentation

## 1980s

- **Susan Kare**
    - Known as the Betsy Ross of the personal computer
    - Worked with Steve jobs to design the original icons for the Macintosh
    - Designed the moving watch, paintbrush, trash can elements

# Gender Disparity in Computing

> [!question] How did the number of women in the field drop so low?

- The reason computer programming was seen as a field that was “natural for women” in history:
    - Due to outdated and sexist ideas about the jobs that women were suited for
    - Men considered computer hardware to be the real skill-oriented challenging job
    - Relegating computer programming work to secretariats and labour

> [!question] If women played a significant role in early programming, then when did we start assuming that computer programming could only be done by men

- Changed by the end of the 1960s
- Men in computer programming wanted to increase the visibility of their field and advance their position
    - Strategy included decreasing the number of women
    - Created own professional organizations and educational requirements to exclude the women already working, and
        - Discourage women from entering the field
    - Male-biased tests that equated masculine traits with programmers
    - Exams where men shared answers with other professionals in their organization
    - Industry ran ads on sexist slogans
        - Claimed women were linked to human error and inefficiency
        - Despite the fact that women pioneered programming

> [!question] Why is there still such a large gap in the number of men vs. women in computer programming related fields? Why is the field represented as male-centric today?

- Shifted in 1984
- Home computers and video games entered the market
- Ad campaigns were run that represented these new innovations as toys and devices that should be targeted towards young boys
    - Focused exclusively on getting young boys interested in owning computers or working in that field
- 1984: 37% of CS majors were women
    - By 2014: the number dropped to 18%
- GitHub research found that women’s coding suggestions were more likely to be approved
    - Only if their gender was not revealed

# Gender, Computing, and Society

## Gender Disparity in Computing

![](https://i.imgur.com/0UyWG65.png)

### Targeting Male Users/Purchasers

- ==Personal computer==
    - Computer became a personal product people started buying and using at their home
    - In most families, men were the main earning person of the family
    - → Personal computer industry started targeting their choice
    - 1984 report by Ebury Publishing:
        - Reported that in a typical family, only ==5% of mothers and 19% of daughters== were using a computer at home
        - vs. 25% of fathers and 51% of sons

### Tropes of Femininity and Gendered Portrayals of Women in Gaming (and Beyond)

- As computers were becoming more popular, video games were also more ==targeted towards men==
- Computer and video games become popular in the 1980s
    - Many were primarily action-oriented and not designed from a woman’s POV
    - Stereotypical characters featured prominently → Were not inviting towards women
        - e.g., Damsel in distress, weak
- The “damsel-in-distress,” “persecuted maiden,” or “princess in jeopardy” is a classic theme in world literature, art, film, and video games
    - Most notably in those that have a lot of action

### Childhood Education and Socialization

- Diminished participation by women relative to men in computer science
    - Dates from 1984 following ==mass marketing of personal computers to boys as toys to play games==
- ==The association of computing with being uncool==
    - High school girls often envisage a career in computing as a lifetime in an isolated cubical writing code
    - “Uncool factor” affects both male and female high school students, but
        - Seems to have more of a negative effect on female students
- Computer programmers depicted in popular media are overwhelmingly male
    - → Contributing to an ==absence of role models for would-be female computer programmers==

## The Education Gap

> [!important]+ Women pursuing computer science degrees decrease since early 1980s
> ![|center](https://i.imgur.com/vZDNp4A.png)

![|center](https://i.imgur.com/geoPhpp.png)

- More women than ever are earning STEM degrees
- Are catching up to men in earning bachelor’s degrees in science and engineering subjects, but
- By field of study, women earned only 19% of CS degrees at bachelor level in 2016
    - vs. 37% in 1984
- Marketing targeting young boys → Boys had advantage when studying CS in college
    - Had lots of experience that girls did not have
- Second decrease in 2000:
    - Research done by CMU Associate Dean
    - Main issues are in interesting and retaining women in CS
        - Feelings of concerns of experience gap
        - Confidence and doubts
        - Interest in curriculum and pedagogy

> [!obs]+ A strange paradox
> - In counties that empower women, they are less likely to choose math and science professions
> - ? What explains the tendency for nations that have traditionally less gender equality to have more women in STEM than their gender-progressive counterparts do?
>     - Paper published by Psychological Science
>     - Could have to do with the fact that women in countries with higher gender inequality are simply seeking the clearest possible path to financial freedom
>     - Typically path leads through STEM professions

## The Employment Gap

![](https://i.imgur.com/mEYNdri.png)

- Only 26% of computing workforce is comprised of women
    - 3% for Black women
    - 1% for Latina women
- 11% of senior leadership in tech companies are women

![](https://i.imgur.com/rEo0VG4.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/lprzREd.png)

- Women in tech by country in many countries is less than 30%
- The percentage of tech jobs that are women is less than 25% in big tech companies
    - Amazon did not publish the % women in tech jobs in 2020

![](https://i.imgur.com/3RaSkYT.png)

- The average tech wage for women in Europe in 2017 is less than $60K USD
- The gender pay gap for tech jobs in Europe is 10-35%

## The Workplace Culture Gap

![](https://i.imgur.com/GkKfljY.png)

- One of the reasons why women are not entering tech jobs at the same rate as men can be traced back to the male-dominated workplace
- 2017 pool in Pew Research Center reported that 50% of women in STEM said that they have experienced gender discrimination at work vs. 19% of men in STEM
    - 62% for women with postgraduate degrees
    - 74% in computer jobs
    - 78% in mostly male workplaces
- Male-dominated workplaces pay less attention to gender diversity (42%)
    - Cause women to feel a need to prove themselves all or some of the time (79%)

> [!important] Workplace culture is not as inviting as we would like it to be for women

- Preventing a lot of women from going into the workplace
- Even after graduating with STEM degree, women are reluctant to move forward with a career in STEM

## The Founder Gap

- Only 1 in 4 startups have a female founder
- 40% have at least 1 woman on the board of directors
- 42% have at least 1 woman in an executive position

> [!important] The founder’s gender has a direct impact on gender diversity

- Startups with a female founder are slightly ==less likely to rely on venture capital== and slightly more likely to tap friends and family for their next source of *funding*

## The Pay Gap

> [!important]+ Women are not only *underrepresented* in STEM, but are also *underpaid*
> - Has not changed in over 25 years

- For computing fields, ==women earn 87% of what men earn==
- Women are also more ==concerned with compensation==
    - ==52% of women== care about compensation and pay
    - vs. ==33% of men==
- ==75% of men== believe their employer ==offers equal pay==
    - vs. ==42% of women== say the same

![](https://i.imgur.com/K3ASbMf.png)

- Given women’s race, this number can be even worse

## The Retention Gap

- Once a diploma is earned and work begins, the numbers for women in tech are perhaps even more troubling
    - A **leaky pipeline** between education and workforce
        - ==Difficult to retain women in STEM jobs== once they’ve graduated with a STEM degree
- Only ==38% of women== who majored in computer science are ==working in the field==
    - vs. ==53% of men==
- Only ==24% of women== with an engineering degree ==still work in engineering==
    - vs. ==30% of men==

# Misogyny in Big Tech Companies

## Google

- 2017: An internal 10-page memo
    - Referred to as Google’s ideological ecochamber
    - Mailed to more than 40,000 people at Google
    - Done by James Damore — a software engineer
    - About Google’s culture and diversity policies
- Software engineer argued:
    - Women — because of biological differences they had — need to work in less stressful environments
        - Work in areas of computing related to aesthetics
        - vs. the logics behind it
        - Because they are more prone to stress
        - → Not suited for a job involved in logic
- Allegations had no basis; just misogynistic ideologies
- Google fired this engineer

## Uber

- Former Uber employee Susan Fowler
    - “When I joined Uber, the organization I was part of was 25% women. By the time I was trying to transfer to another eng organization, this number dropped down to less than 6%”
    - Complained that her manager sexually harassed her over an internal chatting software
    - “The HR rep began the meeting by asking me if I had noticed that ==I was the common theme in all of the reports== I had been making, and that if I ever considered that I might be the problem”
        - Victim-blaming
    - When HR admitted that this case was sexual harassment, HR said they cannot do anything but give a warning
        - “When I reported the situation, I was told by both HR and upper management that even though this was clearly sexual harassment and he was propositioning me, it was this man’s first offense, and they ==they wouldn’t feel comfortable giving him anything other than a warning and a stern talking-to==. Upper management told me that he ‘was a high performer’ (i.e., had stellar performance reviews from his superiors) and they wouldn’t feel comfortable punishing him for what was probably just an innocent mistake on his part”

# Sexuality, Identity, and Computing

> [!obs]+ The situation is worse with the LGBTQ+
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/JGNJkfZ.png)
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/rJqjism.png)

- In many countries, people suspected of being LGBTQ+ are being jailed, physically abused, and worse
    - 72 jurisdictions criminalize private, consensual, same-sex, sexual activity
- Even in developed countries, there is no explicit prohibition for discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity
    - Employer can kick someone out solely because they are not okay with their sexual orientation and gender identity
- This population is further marginalized and further less protected by the law
    - → Makes things worse

## LGBTQ in STEM

- Very low studies and statistics on representation of LGBTQ individuals in the STEM workforce and education
- LGBTQ people are roughly 20% less represented in STEM fields than expected
- When LGBTQ people persist in STEM → Report more negative workplace experiences than their non-LGBTQ counterparts
- Roughly 70% of out STEM faculty members report feeling uncomfortable in their department

## Why Diversity and Inclusion?

- & Every person brings a unique perspective to problem solving
- US economy could save $9 billion annually if organizations were more effective at implementing diversity and inclusion policies for LGBT staff

> [!summary]+ Benefits for individuals
> - LGBT employees who spend considerable time and effort hiding identity in workplace:
>     - Experience higher levels of stress and anxiety
>     - → Resulting in health problems and work-related complaints

> [!summary]+ Benefits for companies
> - Employers will benefit from lower legal costs related to discrimination lawsuits
> - Lower health insurance cost, through improved health of employees
> - Company would likely gain a larger market share among the LGBT consumers
>     - In today’s world, no surprise that publicized discrimination causes current customers to leave brands
>     - Number of same-sex households has increased by 80% from 2000-2010
>         - Number is bigger now
>         - → Buying power of LGBTQ consumers are also on the rise

- By adopting diversity and inclusion (only thinking about the economic impact)
    - Both individuals and companies can benefit!
- 2014 article in Scientific American “How Diversity Makes Us Smarter”:
    - Notes that “simply interacting with individuals whoa re difference forces group members to prepare better, to anticipate alternative viewpoints, and to expect that reaching consensus will take effort”
- & Diversity can increase the efficacy and innovation of teams
    - Study of 4,277 companies in Spain:
        - ==Companies with more women were more likely to introduce radical new innovations into the market==
- Another study looking at profitability across 20,000 firms in 91 countries:
    - ==Companies with more female executives were shown to be more profitable==
- Also are laboratory studies to show that ==diverse teams have increased performance==

## Diversity vs. “Meritocracy”

- Some people argue diversity vs. meritocracy
    - Logic is that we should recruit on the basis of merit, not gender/sexual orientation
    - Quotas recruit on the basis of gender and so are by definition *unmeritocratic*
    - & This is a **myth** used to ==justify the privilege-based status quo==
- & Recruitment without gender/sexual orientation quotas is not meritocratic
    - Rather, it is based on (male) gender, privilege, and an uneven playing field
- & Criteria that we use to determine merit are problematic
    - GPAs or other metrics of criteria that we use are biased, based on status quo, which is
        - Result of the uneven playing field
- & One common denominator in our assessments of “quality” and “merit” is that we ==tend to base these judgements on the status quo==
    - When opponents of gender/sexual orientation quotas argue in favour of merit, ==what they are actually defending is the status quo==
    - Not defending the merit

## Losing LGBTQ+ in STEM

- We are losing a lot of LGBTQ members in STEM
- Alarming
    - All of the issues aforementioned are worse for LGBTQ members
- Among undergraduate students, LGBTQ women are more likely to think about switching to a non-computing major due to a low sense of belong
    - 71% thought about changing to a non-computing major due to ==low belonging==
    - 29% of LGBTQ men
    - 22% of heterosexual women
    - 15% of heterosexual men
- For LGBT students, a stem career is a less-likely option

# Feminist Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

> [!question] How to make design “gender-neutral,” or to remove or minimize the presence of gender in design?

> [!summary]+ Six proposed emphases for feminist HCI
> 1. **Pluralism**
> 2. **Participation**
> 3. **Advocacy**
> 4. **Ecology**
> 5. **Embodiment**
> 6. **Self-disclosure**

## Pluralism

- Refers to design that ==resist any single, totalizing, or universal point of view== or user experience
- Examples:
    - More than one versions
    - Customizable designs
    - Personalizable designs
- Modular smart watches
    - Can make your own smart watch
    - e.g., If you wanted a bluetooth module, or wifi module, or any other module

## Participation

- Refers to ==valuing participatory *processes* in the creation and evaluation== of design prototypes
    - Therefore producing models/design that work for/appeal to more people
- Examples:
    - Talk to others when designing
    - Value everybody’s opinions
    - Allow everybody to take part in design
    - Represent everybody with respect in design

## Advocacy

- There are going to be groups that are not going to be represented well
    - e.g., Children, minorities, refugees, etc.
- → Important to advocate for these groups
- ! Two opposing risks in the design of standard research models:
    - Risk that ==standard empirical research does not account for the range of experiences==
        - May perpetuate regressive and harmful practices and structures in the service of usability
    - Risk that research with “too strong” of a focus on advocacy runs the ==risk of imposing researchers’ own values on users and other stakeholders==
- & Equitable advocacy takes this dilemma seriously
    - In cases where participants are not ready to participate:
        - Have to allow them to select their own advocates, or
        - Respect their privacy
    - If some concerns are hard to express:
        - Have to account for this in our research models
            - i.e., Design research models that are accessible/make sense to a range of language and education levels

## Ecology

- Considering the *ecology of design*:
    - Refers to maintaining an understanding that what we design, how we design it, why we design it, etc. is ==all affected by pre-existing designs that we take for granted==
        - These designs may benefit some more than others
        - Designs may be built on biases, assumptions, etc.
    - Means keeping in mind ==how, when, why==, etc. objects, ideas, and artifacts become *normative*, and shape our assumptions of what new forms of design are important, necessary, etc.
- Principle of ecology in feminist HCI:
    - You need to think about how people are going to be represented when they are using your artifact
        - In terms of society, culture, symbol that your product is perpetuating
        - How your product fits into the social context of how it is going to be used
- Examples:
    - Think beyond the product you are designing
    - Think about the larger social and political scenario
    - e.g., The way a house is designed has an impact on structuring the lives of people who live in it

## Embodiment

- Prioritizes the ==experienced, *sensory* aspects of design==, and how
    - Different people will necessary have different sensory encounters or experiences
    - Based on their own bodies, understandings, backgrounds, etc.
- Embodiment focuses on the *material* part of the experience
    - How the sensory aspects of design in your product is going to be experienced by different people
    - How people are going to have difference experiences
    - How it is going to feel like when they are interacting with it
    - What does the interface look like
- Embodiment and ecology concern ==how this product is going to be perceived==
    - Embodiment talks about material aspect
    - Ecology takes about the social and cultural aspect of your artifact
- Examples:
    - Consider how users will be connected with the artifact materially
        - Not psychologically
        - e.g., We should not only think about the interface of a smart watch, we also have to think about how users will be wearing that in various contexts
    - Also important to consider how users will be represented while using the artifact

## Self-disclosure

- Emphasizes the importance of *self-disclosure* prioritizes the user’s own rights/abilities to define themselves, their interests, etc.
- Calls attention to how software/design asks users to categorize and understand themselves in ways that may rely on certain assumptions about class, resources, etc. and keeps the power of *self-definition*
- Examples:
    - Be transparent about the design assumption
    - Help users understand how technology works
    - Answer all of their questions
    - Explain which of their private/personal data your application is using and how

## Opportunities with Design

> [!example]+ Twitter
> - Was not intended to do many of the applications it ended up doing
> - Was simply a social media application
> - Saw in 2017:
>     - \#MeToo movement
>     - Gave voice through its design
