## Review

- Last time: [[Preformationism]]
    - A response to the difficulty of reconciling mechanism with embryonic development
        - Talked about Malebranche’s **ovism**
            - We were all inside the egg from our mother before she was born
            - Before she was born, she was in an egg inside her mother
            - And on and on until the dawn of time
- Doubt many people were swayed to become committed preformationists

### Organic Unity and Purposiveness

- One of the central arguments that Malebranche used for preformationism:
    - & Living things look designed
        - Look like they have purposes and goals
    - Furthermore:
        - & Each of their parts depends on the whole organisms for its function
        - e.g., Just a heart does not do you much good without a circulatory system, lungs, nerves, etc.
- Recall Aristotle:
    - Believed the heart was the first thing to come into existence when embryo is developing, and last that stops when you die
    - Malebranche would ask:
        - What good is a heart without the veins and arteries?
        - What good is it without nerves to make it move?
        - What is a heart going to do for you without all of the other parts that it serves?
- & Not only do all the parts fit together, but they depend for their existence on every other part

## Kant’s Critique of Mechanism

> [!info]+ Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) made a very similar argument, though *not* for preformationism
> - % Malebranche is 1638-1715
> - Kant is not arguing for preformationism, but identifies the same problem
>     - Kant might be the more famous version of identifying this problem

- Kant was on board with the idea that ==scientific explanations of material things should be mechanical==
- ! But also thought living things posed a particular *problem*
    - Hard to explain in mechanical terms
    - Thinks they are *impossible* to explain exclusively in mechanical terms

### The Unity of Organisms

- Kant observed, in all living things:
    - & The *parts* seem to serve the survival of the *whole*, and
    - & The *whole* produces the *parts*
- e.g., Why does a tree have leaves?
    - Because they want to do photosynthesis
    - Leaves are *for* gathering chemical energy for the survival of the tree
    - Tree produces the leaves
    - Tree produces just the kind of leaves that it needs to survive
        - According to its way of getting by in the world
    - & Parts and the wholes co-constitute
        - Leaves are constituted by the tree
        - Tree is constituted by the leaves
        - They depend mutually on each other
        - % This kind of circular philosophy was what the mechanical philosophy was trying to banish from our way of seeing things
            - Recall Hobbes’ critique of Aristotle:
                - Aristotelian essences give us this circular explanation
                - Why do things fall down? Because they have this essence that makes them want to return to their proper place in the Earth
                - Kind of like saying they fall down, because they fall down
                - Circular explanation
                    - Does not really get you under the surface of things
                - Therefore, we should just do *efficient causation*
                    - Efficient causes do not lead you to this illusion of explanation where you do not really have one
- Kant notes:
    - Living things have this character where the parts are constituted by the whole
    - If you want to understand the whole, then you have to understand the parts
    - If you want to understand the parts, then you have to understand the whole
    - $ Looks like the kind of question that requires some type of circular explanation
        - In this case: about the *final causes* — purposes or goals of the parts of the thing

> [!quote]+ Kant, 1790/2000, 5:360
> “nature, considered as a mere mechanism, could have formed itself in a thousand different ways without hitting precisely upon the unity in accordance with such a rule”

- A tree could have cactus spikes, little fingers instead of leaves, hair
    - We know all those things are mechanically possible
        - In the sense that there is no law of nature against their existence
    - ? Why did a tree come up with leaves?
        - Unless if you understand how a tree is supposed to get by in the world, it is a really weird coincidence that happen to be the perfect thing that keep the tree alive

### Hollow Bones

![](https://i.imgur.com/aTiPyaB.png)

- Kant makes the following argument:
    - If you look at the way we are built, it is all *contingent*
        - i.e., It could have been otherwise
    - Bones of (most) birds are much less dense than terrestrial animals
        - Practically hollow
        - ? Why would that be the case?
            - Looks **mechanically contingent**
            - Cannot say that it is because of mechanical necessity
                - Know that it is not; there are mechanisms that can perfectly produce non-hollow birds
                - Why do birds have hollow bones?
                - Birds fly; want to fly; how they get by in the world; one of the goals/things it is trying to do
                    - This is not a mechanistic explanation
                    - Explanation in terms of goals and purposes
                        - Exactly the kind of thing that mechanical philosophy said we are not allowed to use
                        - & So it is *mechanically contingent*
                            - % *Contingency* is the kind of thing you are trying to remove by explaining things mechanically
                            - “This looks like this could have been some other way to me”
                            - A good explanation will reduce the contingency of things
                                - “Here is why it had to be this way, or is likely to be this way”
- There does not seem to be a mechanical way of solving this
    - Forget about Darwin for a second
        - Not in this time period yet

### Newton of a Blade of Grass

- Kant:
    - & Believes only mechanical explanations are scientifically *valid*
    - ! But also thinks living things cannot be explained without **teleology**
    - & Therefore there cannot ever be a **==science of living things==**
        - Biology is impossible
        - There can never be a Newton of even a blade of grass

> [!info]+ Kant’s Critique of Mechanism
> - We do not need to go too deep into what Kant thought this demonstrates
>     - He uses it as one of his *antinomies*
>         - Arguments that are meant to show that we must conceptually distinguish the phenomena of experience from the noumena of reality itself
>     - % Not going to be on test
> - Main point for us:
>     - & This argument was still current a generation after Malebranche
>         - You cannot explain living things mechanically

## The Watchmaker

- The Watchmaker
    - Possibly the most famous use of this style of argument
    - By William Paley
    - Book (1802) arguing for the existence of God
        - 10-12 years after Kant was writing
- % Paley is trying to do rational theology
    - Trying to offer an argument for the existence of God

> [!abstract]+ The Watchmaker
> - Paley asks us to imagine walking along a beach and finding a watch
>     - Perfectly constructed such that it keeps good time
> - & One would naturally conclude that it had a *designer*
>     - Would not assume that watch was a natural phenomena; the sand must have swirled around just right so that a watch popped up
>     - Rather, someone made it, someone had a design in mind, and constructed this thing on purpose
>     - Then, when we think about us with our vastly more-intricate construction, we must have been designed

## Paley’s Argument from Design

> [!summary]+ Paley’s Argument from Design
> 1. Living things appear to have been designed
> 2. The only reasonable explanation of the appearance of design is a designer
> 3. Living things were intelligently designed

### 1. Living Things Appear to Have Been Designed

- Paley gives us a brief description of when things ‘appear to have been designed’
    - Gives us some criteria
    - Appearance of design could be deceptive
- ? What does it mean to say that something looks designed?
    - & The parts seem to *serve* a purpose
    - & If the parts were just a little different, they would not serve that purpose
- e.g., You go to a forest → lots of perfectly-good sticks to poke a fire
    - If they bent 15º further, they would still perfectly poke the fire
    - Can stir up a fire with most types of sticks
    - Small variations do not really make a difference to that functionality
    - Therefore, it is not reasonable to conclude that the stick is designed for poking fires
- Criteria for something ‘looking designed’:
    - Need to be something useful
    - Need to be something that if it were just a little bit different, it would not be useful

### 2. The Only Reasonable Explanation of the Appearance of Design is a Designer

- This is an inference to the best explanation
- **Inference to the best explanation**
    - We observe some phenomenon
    - Some hypothesis is the best explanation we can give of it
        - e.g., it must have been designed that way
    - Therefore, that hypothesis is likely to be true
- Problems with this approach:
    - What if there was an explanation you just did not think of?
        - The only way to explain the design of living things is to say that God did it
            - % Was 1802; has not thought about natural selection yet
- Sometimes, this approach works well
    - Deflection of light by gravity
        - Predicted by special relativity
        - One of the earliest demonstrations of special relatively was the observation of sunlight during an eclipse
        - Einstein predicts:
            - Light will be deflected by heavy objects
            - Because what gravity really is is the curve in space time
            - Newtonian mechanics does not predict that; just says light just goes
            - Einstein says that light will be deflected by heavy objects
            - Heaviest object we have around here is the sun
        - Pointed a telescope right beside the sun during an eclipse
            - Know where they should see the stars
            - Then sees them shifted exactly by the amount that Einstein predicted
        - & We observe that the stars look like they have been shifted
        - & Einstein’s theory of special relativity is the best explanation we can give for the shifting
        - & Therefore, Einstein’s theory of special relativity is probably true

### 3. Living Things Were Intelligently Designed

- If the first two premises are granted:
    - Hard to see how to deny the conclusion
- % Most people think 2. is wrong
    - Since Paley was writing shortly before Darwin’s theory of evolution was published

## The Origin of Species

> [!info]+ This style of argument lost steam after 1859
> - When Darwin published *On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection*

- % People did not leap on board with Darwin’s ideas right away
    - In fact:
        - A vigorous scientific debate persisted for another 100 years

### Orthogenesis

- Some early palaeontologists did not find Darwin’s picture convincing
    - Saw fossils
        - Seemed to show smooth, linear development across massive time-spans
            - e.g., looked like horse legs were just getting longer
                - ![](https://i.imgur.com/TUjUmYB.png)
- Some preferred the idea of *orthogenesis*
- **Orthogenesis**
    - Idea that species change over time according to *internal principles*
    - “Ortho-”
        - Straight line
    - “-genesis”
        - Change in a species over time
- People different on which principles they thought those were
    - From an inner “perfecting principle”
    - To just small mechanical changes across generations
- People who looked at orthogenesis would respond to Darwin:
    - “Your thing about random variations being acted on by selection does not seem to explain the straight lines I am seeing in this fossil graphs”
        - Would be weird if it went on as a straight line for 55 million years
    - Palaeontologists thought that natural selection does not fit with how we think

### Inheritance

> [!important]+ Darwin’s theory of inheritance was also a bit of a problem
> - Darwin was a **pangenesist**
>     - Thought that tiny “gemmules” were collected from all over the body to transmit form to the next generation
>         - Answers the question: why do I look like my parents?
>         - ![](https://i.imgur.com/jmrAzWI.png)
>         - Allows for the inheritance of *acquired* characteristics
>             - e.g., if your parents are sporty and have big, strong bones, muscles, and ligaments, then you will get big, strong bones, muscles, and ligaments
>         - % There is not this crisp separation between the tissues of the body generally and what gets transmitted to the next generation

- August Weismann (1889)
    - Described testing this by cutting the tails off of five generations of mice
    - $ Each new generation of mouse had perfectly formed tails
        - Tails did not even get shorter
            - Maybe there are some tail gemmules carried over, and there are leftover tail information that will diminish over generations
            - But saw none of that
- % This is unsurprising to us
    - We subscribe to the idea that genetic material — the stuff that is inherited — is separate from the rest of your body
    - DNA is usually the thing that gets identified

### Blending Inheritance

- Darwin also subscribed to ‘**blending inheritance**’

![](https://i.imgur.com/RiDg1tA.png)

> [!def]+ Blending inheritance
> - Idea that for any given trait, children will be (on average) a *blend* between their two biological parents

> [!danger]+ Problem for a theory that says natural selection actions on *variation* in a population
> - If you keep blending inheritance in generations, that reduces the variation in further generations
> - i.e., If each next generation is an average of the previous, you very quickly destroy all variation in the population
>     - ! Then, there is nothing for natural selection to act on!

## Inheritance: Chromosomes

- **Chromosomes**
    - First observed and identified as a possible location for hereditary material in late 1800s and early 1900s
- Experiments on drosophila flies
    - & Allowed the very first rough mapping of where on a chromosome a given trait could be coded
        - i.e., where the genes are; where genetic material might reside
        - % They do not have an idea of what a gene is at this time
            - Just say maybe there is a gene for this trait
            - Gene is just a particular bit of genetic information
    - 1920-30s
- $ This is a version of inheritance that is *not* pangenesis
    - Chromosomes are tiny and just a couple
    - Are not migrating from every cell and collecting in reproductive organs
    - Are just chromosomes in the sperm and egg
        - That is where you get your genetic material
        - Called the Weismann barrier
- **Weismann barrier**
    - Barrier between **germ plasm** — stuff that gets passed onto next generation — and rest of your body

## The Modern Synthesis

![](https://i.imgur.com/HiIiXz4.png)

- 1930s to 1940s:
    - Picture of evolution gets developed
    - Called the **Modern Synthesis**

> [!info]+ The Modern Synthesis
> - Taking the idea of mendelian genetics
>     - Work of Mendel from 1800s has been rediscovered and reinvigorated
> - Combined with some mathematical models from physics
>     - Usually used to describe the diffusion of gases in volume
> - & Use mathematics to model changes in gene frequency in a population over time
> - & Showed how you could get something that looked like *blending inheritance* by assuming a ==large number of separate, randomly assorted genes==
>     - Solved the blending inheritance problem

- If you want to understand why you are as how tall as you are:
    - Do not think of it as pure blending
        - Like two colours of paint
    - Think of it as a *swarm* of genes
        - Many of which code for height
    - You do get an averaging, but it does not wipe out the variation
        - Because each individual gene remains in the population
- % Not on test

## DNA

![](https://i.imgur.com/SNFScwC.png)

- 1953:
    - **==Watson and Crick==**
        - Use some x-ray crystallography data they stole from Rosalind Franklin
    - & Published the model of the *structure of DNA*
- Exactly the sort of thing assumed by the Modern Synthesis view

<!-- break -->
- Nobel prize winning biologist Jacques Monod’s 1970 *Chance and Necessity*:
    - Tried to translate for a popular audience what he thought the new science of molecular biology meant for people and our relationship with nature
- Monod:
    - & Argued that we are basically programmed by our genes
    - Our genes are the product of *natural selection* relentlessly on random variation
- You are programmed by genetic information encoded in your DNA
    - Basic hardwiring is given by DNA
    - DNA has been shaped by the relentless filtering mechanism of natural selection for a billion years or more
- In this sense, Monod argues:
    - We are *accidental creatures*
    - Who appear designed only because of the certainty of death for any creature that happens to vary in the wrong ways

### The Ancient Covenant

> [!quote]+ Monod, quoted in Prigogine and Toffler p.3
> “Man must at last finally awake from his millenary dream; and in doing so, awake to his total solitude, his fundamental isolation. Now does he at last realize that […] he lives on the boundary of an alien world. A world that is deaf to his music, just as indifferent to his hopes as it is to his suffering or his crimes.”

> [!quote]+ Monod, pp. 110-111
> “Through its properties, by the microscopic function that establishes between DNA and protein, as between organism and medium, an entirely one-way relationship, this system obviously defies any ‘dialectical’ description. It is not Hegelian at all, but thoroughly Cartesian: the cell is indeed a machine.”

- Cell is a machine
    - Programmed by DNA
- Cell does not program the DNA
    - & DNA programs the cell
    - One-way relationship
- Nothing about your life or experience, or anything that you do will go into your DNA
    - DNA is the only thing that lasts of you
    - Structure of DNA is given just by *random chances* that happen to make it through the filter of natural selection

> [!quote]+ This view continues on:
> “We are survival machines — robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes. This is a truth which still fills me with astonishment.”
> – Dawkins

- This is the consensus view that comes out of the Modern Synthesis
    - Genes tell you everything important about you biologically
    - They are the blueprint of the cell
        - And therefore the body
    - Nothing you ever do will change your DNA
    - Your DNA is entirely structured by random chances

## Is the Cell Really a Machine?

> [!tldr]+ Reading
> Daniel J. Nicholson’s *Is the cell really a machine?*

- Nicholson argues:
    - & Equation of cells with machines is misleading
    - Despite being a pervasive metaphor across biology

> [!note]+ Nicholson labels this treatment of cells as little machines: **Machine Conception of the Cell**, aka *mechanicism*
> - ! Keep [[Mechanism]] and MCC separate in our minds
>     - MCC is about *cells*
>         - Rather than all of nature whatsoever
>     - MCC also has more specific things to say about cells than mechanism in general

- % Mechanism is a more general philosophy of science overall
    - Developed during the scientific revolution and so forth
- % MCC: we did not really know there were cells when scientific revolution was happening
    - Certainly did not have very specific ideas of how cells worked

### What is a Machine?

- Says that biology has been treating cells like a machine

> [!question]+ What is a machine?
> “…a machine can be characterized in very general terms as **a device with fixed interacting parts that operate in a coordinated fashion to produce a predetermined outcome**. More specifically, one can identify four distinctive properties of machines that are particularly relevant in contemporary formulations of the MCC.”
> (p.109, emphasis added)

> [!summary]+ Machine
> - & Describable by blueprints — a list of *parts* and how they *fit together*
>     - Machine is something that has a blueprint, or
>     - Can create a blueprint of it
>     - One way thinking about the job of cellular biology:
>         - Determine what the blueprint of the cell is
>         - Blueprint has a list of *parts* and says how they are *arranged*
> - & Designed to efficiently perform a specific function
>     - Machine does a thing and does it well
> - & Follows the same sequence of steps every time to achieve that function
>     - When you describe something as *mechanical*:
>         - Describing it as something that has a fixed or routinized process for doing something
>     - If it is a spontaneous, new process every time:
>         - Not really a machine-like behaviour
> - & You can start and stop the machine without it falling apart
>     - If you remove your liver from the whole organism, it stops being a liver pretty quickly
>     - Can stop the machine
>         - e.g., if car breaks down, it stops the machine work
>     - Can look at the individual bits and understand why it is the way it is

- % Nicholson is going to argue these characteristics of machines do *not* work for *cells*

### Describable by Blueprints — a List of Parts and how They Fit together vs. Self-Organized

#### Cellular Architecture

![](https://i.imgur.com/dgN0q6D.png)

- The image above looks like a *blueprint*
- Prior to 20th century:
    - Studying cellular architecture involved killing the cell
        - Immobilizing the parts
    - This is a reasonable way of representing how cells work
        - via techniques available during 20th century for studying cells
        - If you want to look at the inside of cells:
            - Kill the cell, then take a slice or cross section
            - Look at it under a microscope
- 21st century:
    - Labelling techniques allows cell biologists to follow individual molecules, proteins, enzymes, etc.
    - Can do things like:
        - Minor variations in the molecules that you can detect using nuclear magnetic resonance
        - Can watch the molecules as it goes through a living cell
    - Have the ability to look at the insides of a living cell
    - Nicholson says:
        - & This gives a much different picture of their internal arrangement
        - Does not have a blueprint

> [!important]+ Nicholson’s main argument
> - What they found from 21st century:
>     - A living cell involves much less *self-assembly* than believed
>     - A lot more **self-organization**

- Machines are solid, but life is squiggly and wiggly:
    - Cell is squiggly and wiggly
    - Machines are not like that
    - So cells are not machines
- What Nicholson is going to say about cellular architecture:
    - Things move around quite a lot
    - Things are much more dynamic than what was believed
    - Much more dynamic for what is appropriate for a blueprint

#### Self-Assembly

- Sometimes, complicated-looking things put themselves together

<!-- break -->
- **Self-assembly**
    - When molecules clump together into a shape naturally

> [!example]+ Lipid bilayers
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/bsYXlxd.png)
> - Form our cell walls
> - Are the result of basic chemistry
>     - Little white circles are hydrophilic
>         - Dissolve in water
>     - Dangly things are hydrophobic
>         - Dissolve in oil
>         - Do not like dissolving in water
>     - One end is attracted to water
>     - Other end is repelled by it
>     - % Causes molecules to arrange themselves neatly
> - Put all this stuff in water
>     - → Hydrophobic ends want to get away from water
>     - → Hydrophilic ends want to be near water
>     - The kind-of equilibrium point for that kind of thing is one of *liposome* or *micelle*
>     - These are the ways that these things kind of spontaneously put them together in a shape like this
> - Call this **self-assembly**

> [!important]+ It takes *no work* to maintain these shapes

#### Mitotic Spindle

> [!quote]+ Duncan and Wakefield, 2011, p. 330, quoted in Nicholson, p. 111
> “The traditional view of the mitotic spindle apparatus as a molecular machine which is built through a defined irreversible set of instructions is gradually being replaced. It can instead be envisaged as a self-regulating dynamic structure where multiple pathways of MT \[microtubule] generation are spatially and temporally controlled and integrated, constantly ‘talking’ to one another and modifying the behaviour of their MTs in order to maintain a flexible yet robust steady-state spindle.”

- Mitotic spindle
    - You want to divide your cells
        - Cell division happens all the time
        - But you only have one set of DNA in your cell, so how do you split that up?
            - Mitotic spindle

![](https://i.imgur.com/iTJJaP8.png)

- **Mitotic spindle**
    - Structure that grows thousands of tiny microtubules
    - % Mitosis is the cell division
    - % Each pink thing in middle is a chromosome
    - Little tubes out of nowhere grow and collect up the chromosomes between the two ends of the spindles
    - Spindles retract each one
        - Which takes half a copy of the chromosome
    - Split the chromosome → Two copies of the genes in half → Each one takes their half to the new cell

![](https://i.imgur.com/8QH6D8O.png)

> [!quote]+ Sridhara, A., & Shimamoto, Y. (2024). Microtubule choreography: Spindle selforganization during cell division. Biophysical Reviews, 16(5), 613-624.
> “During cell division, the network of microtubules undergoes massive rearrangement to self-organize into the spindle, a bipolar structure essential for accurate chromosome segregation. This structure ensures the stable transmission of the genome from the mother cell to two daughter cells, yet the process by which the ordered architecture emerges from a collection of protein “parts” remains a mystery.” (p.613)

- % As of 2024, still do not know how structure works
- All of the individual molecules are there already
- Somehow:
    - Makes this very orderly structure
    - Does not impale the chromosome, but attracts the chromosome to where the two spindles are overlapping
    - Walks the chromosome right in-between the middle of the two
    - Each spindle binds to one half of it
    - When they are all ready, they retract, pull back, split the chromosome
- We know what most of the molecules are
    - Mix in a test tube → shake it → one of these things will appear, right?
        - Because we understand the parts
        - Therefore we understand the system
        - That is how reductionism works
        - ! But that is not true
        - Still do not know how this works

> [!important]+ This is not self-assembly, but **self-organization**

#### Self-Organization

- Self-assembly with lipid bilayers:
    - At the lowest energy point
    - A kind of equilibrium

> [!info]+ In self-organization:
> - & System is *not* at thermodynamic equilibrium
> - & Energy (and usually matter) flow through the system
> - Without any central authority planning it out:
>     - & System *spontaneously* becomes *orderly* in some way

- e.g., Hurricane is an example of a self-organized system
    - Nobody plans a hurricane
    - No central hurricane planning authority that says:
        - Go counter-clockwise this time!
    - System *spontaneously* becomes *ordered*
        - And that is the problem with hurricanes
        - Air is not moving in a nice disordered way
            - All way too orderly such that it drowns people and knocks down building
    - & Different from self-assembly because energy is *flowing* through the system
        - Hurricane is feeding off the energy of the air and ocean
        - Needs that constant flow of energy to sustain that orderly-ness
            - If it goes into equilibrium → will stop doing this

#### A Self-organizing Cytoskeleton

> [!important]+ Nicholson argues
> - While some parts of the cell are self-assembled:
>     - & Many are self-organized

- Lipid bilayers are part of the story of how your cell walls are organized
    - Quite a lot of the cell wall is like that
    - % That is not in the *genome*
        - No gene that says: here’s how to make a lipid bilayer
        - Just something that these molecules tend to do

> [!example]+ Cytoskeleton
> - Set of microtubes that give the cell structure
> - When parts of this are labelled:
>     - Turns out that there is a constant turn-over of matter
>         - Molecules are constantly unbuilding and rebuilding the cytoskeleton
>         - Matter is constantly cycling through cytoskeleton
>         - Not fixed (like a skeleton, according to Nicholson)
>         - It is **self-organizing** → constantly churning energy through it
>     - Which requires energy
>         - If you stop flow of energy, thing just falls apart
> - Only form is preserved
>     - Even that varies dynamically

- Microtubules
    - Do not just grow and they are done
    - Are constantly cycling molecules through themselves
        - Using energy to do that
    - Way that they go through these growing and shrinking cycles is guided by emergent properties of ending up with the chromosomes in just the right spot to be separated

#### Form and Matter

> [!important]+ Nicholson talks about how cell *preserves* form by ==cycling through matter==
> - Keep the shape of the cytoskeleton by moving matter through it constantly

> [!quote]+ Nicholson, p. 112
> “More broadly, the transition from a structural to a processual conception of the cellular architecture implies shifting our attention from matter to form. Due to its dynamic nature, ==what persists in a cell over time is its form==, not its matter: the individual molecules that make up a cell come and go, but ==its over-arching organization remains==.”

- “Structural to a processual conception of the cellular architecture”:
    - From machine conception to squiggly-wiggly conception
- & Entirely different matter, but same form
- Some people argue:
    - There is no real reason they have to disassemble you at this end
    - If you believe that you are identical to your matter, then it just kills you
        - And makes a duplicate
    - If you believe that you are identical with your form
        - You are not dead
        - Form is reproduced perfectly
            - Just with different matter

> [!note]+ Nicholson does not give any indication of *formal* causes
> - Unlike Aristotle
> - Nicholson literally means the shape/arrangement of the thing

### Designed to Efficiently Perform a Specific Function vs. a Balance of Efficiency and Adaptability

- Nicholson wants to contrast “designed to efficiently perform a specific function” with a **balance of efficiency and adaptability**
    - Thinks machines are generally designed to efficiently do one thing
- You want parts of your biology to be efficient
    - But also want it to be multifunctional
    - e.g., proteins

![](https://i.imgur.com/KGdqAMS.png)

- Primary structure of protein
    - Sequence of amino acids
- Secondary structure
    - Curls into itself
    - Then can have overall structure as those curls curl onto themselves

#### Form and Function

> [!quote]+ Alberts, 1998, p. 291, as quoted in Nicholson, p. 113
> “Why do we call the large protein assemblies that underlie cell function protein machines? Precisely because, like the machines invented by humans to deal efficiently with the macroscopic world, these protein assemblies contain highly coordinated moving parts. Within each protein assembly, intermolecular collisions are not only restricted to a small set of possibilities, but reaction C depends on reaction B, which in turn depends on reaction A—just as it would in a machine of our common experience.“

- & A protein’s specific conformation (shape) determines how it functions
- Nicholson:
    - People think of proteins as tiny machines
    - So constrained by the shape of the protein to have one functional profile
    - That constraining of possibilities makes a protein efficient at doing what it does
    - Makes a sequence of events

#### Studying Protein Structure

- One of the reasons why you might have the impression that protein structures are like this:
    - The way we used to study protein structure
- X-ray crystallography
    - Technique used to observe the structure of DNA
        - What Rosalind Franklin used
    - Take some DNA → crystallize it into a solid → shoot x-rays through it
    - The way the x-rays scatter tells you about the *structure*

#### Intrinsically Disordered Proteins

- Recall:
    - 20th century:
        - Thought the cell was a machine
    - 21st century:
        - Now we know it is a lot different from that
- Studying proteins using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy:
    - & → Many proteins are partly or completely disordered
        - & i.e., they change shape
        - Quite a lot of proteins do not curl up into a shape, or at least, do not curl up into just one shape
            - Sometimes, part of the proteins curl up into a stick but a part of it stays wiggly
                - Can go into one or two different shapes or can be **intrinsically disordered**
                    - Meaning the line of amino acids does not have any one shape

> [!quote]+ Nicholson, p. 114
> “In mammals, it has been estimated that approximately 75% of signalling proteins and about 50% of all proteins contain at least one disordered region of more than 30 amino acids, and as many as 25% of all proteins are completely disordered”

- & At least 25% of proteins are squiggly and wiggly!
- Fact remains that the shape of the thing determines how it is going to act with other parts of the cell
    - What it can do chemically crucially depends on its shape
    - But 25% of proteins do not have any fixed shape!
- Recall description from Alberts:
    - Claimed cells are regular and reliable *machines* made out of proteins
        - Because proteins do the same thing because of their specific confirmation
- ! But not really!
    - That is how it looked when we studied proteins using x-ray crystallography
    - & Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy shows that most proteins do not have a fixed shape and therefore function
    - % The parts do not stay put as it were

### Follow the Same Sequence of Steps Every time to Achieve vs. Stochastic and Probabilistic

#### Scales and Physical Forces

> [!info]+ Nicholson argues that our intuitions, based on medium-sized objects, mislead us about the cellular level.
> - Nicholson wants us to think about what it is like to be inside a cell
> - & Scale matters a lot in terms of which forces dominate
>     - e.g., a whale experiences water as thought it were much thinner than us
>         - Whereas a paramecium experiences it as a thick soup

- When it gets smaller than a cell, it gets kind of weird

#### Brownian Motion

- **Brownian motion**
    - A major determinant of how things move at the cellular level
    - Just the movement caused by being jostled at a molecular level
    - *Randomness* plays a huge role in determining how things will move in the cell

![](https://i.imgur.com/p83UiaP.png)

- If you put a glass of warm water and put one dust mite in it, it will move something like this
    - Random, jiggling-around
    - Being buffeted by water molecules
    - Being kicked left and right in some random way
    - Call that **Brownian motion**

#### Kinesin ‘walks’

![](https://i.imgur.com/Kdck3JG.png)

- May have seen video of little machines ‘walking’ along microtubules
    - Nicholson argues this (may be) misleading
- This apparently driven behaviour is one model of how this works
- Another is a kind of *ratchet* system
    - *Random* jiggling is biased in one direction by burning ATP
- % Things are doing stuff randomly
    - But the randomness is how this system works
    - Rather than an impediment to its function

#### Stochastic Gene Expression

- Not all of your genes are on all of the time
- Genes can be more or less expressed
    - Transcribed into RNA which ribosomes use as a pattern for proteins
- That is how you get different cell types
    - Liver cells are different from skin cells because of differences in gene expression
- Inducers help determine their level of expression
    - Inducers are chemicals
    - Help increase the degree of expression in a given cell
- Researchers believes that this was a simple linear relationship
    - As in the ‘graded response’ picture
    - The more amount of an inducer → the more every cell expresses that gene
    - Got that picture because they could only study groups of cell
- But now that they can study individual cells:
    - & Turns out gene expression happens in stochastic *bursts*
    - Each individual cell kind of looks like it is doing its own thing
        - A little bit random

### You Can Start and Stop the Machine without it Falling apart vs. Dense Interactive Causal Networks

#### Gene Regulatory Networks

![](https://i.imgur.com/gaVz4Ul.png)

*Map of the gene regulatory network for e.coli.*

- Genes can increase or decrease the activity of other genes
    - Can turn each other up or down
    - Activity in one gene can be an inducer for the activity for another gene
        - Or a suppressor
- Knowing how active a gene will be in an environment requires (at minimum):
    - Knowing what all the other genes are doing

- Recall:
    - Morgan fly lab
    - Figured out genes for a specific wing shape, for example
    - A gene that programs for a wing shape
        - ! That turns out to not be how genes work
- In general:
    - Genes only do their thing in this wildly complex set of relationships with other genes
    - Cannot know what any one of them are going to do
        - Except in the context of all the others
- & → Dense causal interactions

> [!quote]+ Nicholson, p. 123
> “Monod was wrong. The cell is not a machine, but something altogether different—something more interesting yet also more unruly. It is a bounded, selfmaintaining, steady-state organization of interconnected and interdependent processes; an integrated, dynamically stable, multi-scale system of conjugated fluxes collectively displaced from thermodynamic equilibrium.”
