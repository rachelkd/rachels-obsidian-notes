# Comparative Essay

Explain one traditional position on the nature of life, and relate it to an issue of importance today.
Explain how the traditional position can inform our current understanding, and/or how our current understanding sheds light on the historical position.

- Explain a traditional position on the nature of life
- Explain some issue of importance today
- Give your take on how they interact
- Intro
- Two sections of exegesis
- Argument

Is the cell a machine?

- Can talk about the history of thinking a cell is a machine
- Nicholson’s arguments
- Can talk about Levin
    - Can argue how the definitions of cognition does not really matter as long as it is useful for scientific work
    - One of the lectures said that defining life is a waste of time


- Crucially, Levin sees his approach not as a rejection of mechanism *per se*, but as an **expansion or upgrade of it**.
    - The revision is to **integrate information and goal-directed behaviour as causal realities** in our explanations.
        - Similar to Kant’s critique of mechanism
            - [[Mechanism and Microbiology]]
