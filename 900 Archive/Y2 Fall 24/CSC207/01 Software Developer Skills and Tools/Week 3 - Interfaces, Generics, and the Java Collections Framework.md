# Even More Java

> [!questions]- Questions
>
> 1. What are the “Java lookup rules” and how do they work?
> 2. What is a generic class?
> 3. What makes a class abstract? A method?
> 4. What is a Java interface?
> 5. How can we decide whether we should use an interface or an abstract class?
> 6. What is the Java Collections Framework?
> 7. List three classes in the Java Collections Framework.
> 8. What behaviours do you expect to see in an implementing class of `Set`, `Queue`, and `List`?
> 9. Why would we want to write `List<String> x = new ArrayList<>();` instead of `ArrayList<String> x = new ArrayList<>();`?
> 10. When might you want to use List as the type of a variable instead of something more specific?
> 11. When might you NOT want to use List as the type of a parameter in a method’s signature?
> 12. Give an example of how you can bring information from a file into your program and how to write information back to that file.
