CONTEXT:

The Machine Conception of the Cell (MCC)
Daniel J. Nicholson’s 2019 paper challenges the machine conception of the cell (MCC) – the pervasive idea that a living cell is essentially an extremely complex machine. In the MCC view, a cell is “an intricate piece of machinery whose organization reflects a pre-existing design, whose structure is wholly intelligible in reductionistic terms, and whose operation is governed by deterministic laws, rendering its behaviour predictable and controllable—at least in principle.”​

According to Nicholson, this mechanistic framework has dominated molecular biology since the mid-20th century (inspired by thinkers like Jacques Monod) and is reinforced by common metaphors of cellular components as “locks and keys,” “pumps,” “circuits,” and other machine-like parts​

The MCC assumes that every aspect of a cell’s structure and function can be mapped to a kind of blueprint and explained by breaking the cell into discrete mechanical parts and causal circuits. This reductionist, deterministic outlook became deeply ingrained – “so engrained in our minds that we simply take it for granted”​ – yet Nicholson argues it is ultimately a misleading metaphor. Nicholson defines four general properties that machines typically have, which underlie the MCC’s assumptions​: (1) Machines are built from a fixed set of parts according to a blueprint, making them repeatable and fully specified by design; (2) they perform highly specific, constrained functions, enabling prediction and control of their behavior; (3) they execute operations in a precise, efficient sequence of steps each cycle; and (4) a machine’s operation is modular and interruptible – one can take it apart or stop it and it will remain the same machine when reassembled. These characteristics support the belief that cells can be understood by decomposing them into molecular “parts” (genes, enzymes, pathways) and that cellular processes follow predetermined, clockwork-like rules. Nicholson’s core philosophical position is that this mechanistic conception is inadequate: the cell is not literally a machine and trying to treat it as one obscures what makes living systems distinctive.


POTENTIAL POINTS:

Levin redefines the machine metaphor not as a rigid ontological claim but as a flexible, context-dependent heuristic — a protocol for interaction rather than an essence — thereby contrasting sharply with traditional, reductionist views that equate organisms with static, engineered mechanisms.

📌 Evidence from the Article:
“All terms — cognitive, computationalist and mechanistic — are not making claims about what the system is; rather, they are each a statement of a proposed protocol for effectively interacting with the system.”

“If we give up the idea that there needs to be one correct answer and we get comfortable with having to specify context and prospective payoff, we can make real progress.”

🧠 Thoughtful Analysis:
Levin departs from the traditional mechanistic view — one that sees living systems as analogous to predictable, engineered devices — and instead treats metaphors like “machine,” “cognitive,” or “computational” as interactional models, not static truths. In his view, the machine metaphor is useful when it works, not because it tells us what life is, but because it can guide productive engagement with living systems depending on context.

This is a clear philosophical shift from thinkers like Daniel Nicholson, who critiques the machine metaphor in “Is a Cell Really a Machine?” for its inadequacy in accounting for the complexity, autonomy, and dynamism of living cells. Nicholson argues that cells are not reducible to their parts, and that mechanistic analogies can mislead biological understanding.

Levin agrees with the inadequacy, but rather than rejecting the metaphor wholesale (as LTNM does), he redefines its utility: it’s not about ontological correctness but about methodological usefulness — can this frame help us collaborate with the system, understand its goals, or even communicate with it?

🔗 Tie-in to Your Thesis:
This redefinition is central to your thesis: Levin replaces the rigid, mechanistic worldview not by rejecting the machine metaphor outright, but by expanding it to include cognition, agency, and context-sensitive strategies of interaction. In doing so, he blurs the lines between machine and mind, opening space for a more teleological and dynamic understanding of life. The metaphor becomes a tool for engagement, not a constraint on biological thought — a profound philosophical shift that underlies his call for a continuum model of cognition.

🧩 Subpoint (3/3): Replacing Mechanism with a Cognitive Continuum
Subpoint:
Levin replaces the binary, mechanistic framing of life and machines with a spectrum-based model of cognition and agency, arguing that all systems — from cells to cyborgs to engineered machines — exhibit degrees of purposeful behavior, competency, and responsiveness, which must be empirically explored rather than ontologically defined.

📌 Evidence from the Article:
“What places all these systems — living or not — on the same spectrum is the fact that all have aspects that are amenable to the mechanistic and agentic lenses… and none wear their capabilities and limitations on their sleeve (they must be determined by experiment).”

“These questions are unsolvable if we look for a clean, bright line separating these categories.”

“We have left the age where ‘machines’ were easy to delineate… We must give up the comforting notion that we understand matter well enough to say that the limits of our models are equivalent to the limits of the ‘non-living’ world.”

🧠 Thoughtful Analysis:
Levin dismantles the core assumptions of the mechanistic worldview — that life is fundamentally different from machines, that intelligence and purpose arise only in certain biological systems, and that categories like “machine” or “life” are sharply bounded. Instead, he proposes a continuum model in which systems can’t be defined by rigid ontological labels but must be assessed through their behavioral capacities, functional competencies, and goal-directed responses.

This move resolves pseudo-problems like whether a 50% biological/50% synthetic cyborg is a machine or a lifeform — a question that only arises if we insist on binary thinking. By recognizing that cognition, purpose, and agency are distributed traits, Levin opens the door to a new paradigm in which cells, organisms, and machines exist on a fluid spectrum — evaluated not by what they “are” but by what they “do,” how they interact, and how they adapt.

His argument that “none wear their capabilities and limitations on their sleeve” underscores the need for empirical humility — a theme woven throughout his proposal to engineer understanding rather than rely on prescriptive models. This resonates deeply with modern systems biology and AI research, which increasingly find cognitive-like properties in unexpected places (e.g. gene regulatory networks, morphogenetic fields, machine learning agents).

🔗 Tie-in to Your Thesis:
This directly supports your thesis claim that Levin replaces the mechanistic worldview by shifting from a model of life as passive matter-in-motion to one in which all systems are active participants in a cognitive spectrum. Through this, Levin redefines what counts as intelligence and agency, and ultimately proposes a more inclusive and dynamic framework for understanding life — one that transcends traditional dualisms between machine and organism, biology and engineering, mind and matter.

Subpoint:
Levin definitively replaces the binary mechanistic worldview with a pluralist, continuum-based model of cognition and agency. He argues that all systems — biological, synthetic, or hybrid — must be placed on a spectrum of competencies, assessed empirically through interaction, not ontologically defined by static categories like “life” or “machine.”

Evidence:
“All have aspects that are amenable to the mechanistic and agentic lenses, all exhibit surprises and competencies that our formal models do not capture…”

“Let’s get on with the good science of being very specific about our metaphors and what they facilitate versus constrain.”

“We are freed up to do the important work of actually characterizing the sets of tools that may open new frontiers.”

“We owe everyone realistic stories of scaling and gradual metamorphosis along a continuum — not of magical and sharp transitions.”

Analysis:
Levin’s pluralism is not relativism — it’s a call for empirical humility. He replaces categorical thinking (“machines are not alive,” “cells are not machines”) with a spectrum of persuadability and interaction, where systems earn their status through behavior, plasticity, and responsiveness, not composition. Importantly, this isn’t just an abstract philosophy — it’s a research methodology. We don’t assume what a system is; we test how it acts and respond accordingly.

He argues that minds, agency, and goals are not exclusive to wet biology; they can emerge from any medium, given the right organization. That argument unseats the materialist roots of both mechanism and biological exceptionalism and lays the groundwork for a more inclusive science of cognition — what Levin calls the study of diverse intelligence.

Tie-In to Thesis:
This is the clearest expression of your thesis’s final movement: Levin doesn’t just revise the mechanistic worldview — he replaces it with a dynamic continuum that emphasizes informational agency, self-organization, and purposefulness. His framework reshapes biology into a science not of parts, but of interactive, goal-oriented systems, expanding our philosophical conception of life far beyond matter-in-motion.

🔷 Second Point: Redefining the Machine Metaphor
Subpoint:
Levin recasts “machine” not as a rigid category but as a tool-enabled metaphor, whose utility depends on the context, purpose, and system being studied. He pushes against the naïve assumption that machines are transparent, deterministic, and fully knowable, insisting instead that machines — like minds — exceed our formal representations.

Evidence:
“There are no machines anywhere — living or not – that are totally encompassed by their materials and algorithms…”

“Let’s specify… precisely where on the spectrum of persuadability one plans to approach a system.”

“All we have are metaphors, some better than others…”

“It turns out, some of the same tools behavioral scientists and biologists have been using… can be used to understand and make machines.”

Analysis:
Rather than discarding the machine metaphor as LTNM does, Levin re-engineers it. A machine, in his framing, is not a deterministic, closed system; it can be cybernetic, goal-directed, self-organizing, and even capable of self-reference and reprogramming. This new machine metaphor can describe both cells and synthetic constructs, without falling into misleading simplifications.

By redefining what it means to call something a machine, Levin blurs the boundaries between organism and artifact — a direct contrast to Nicholson’s critique, which targets the overextension of classical, mechanistic analogies in biology. Where Nicholson argues that cells resist being seen as machines, Levin counters: only if your machine metaphor is outdated.

Tie-In to Thesis:
This redefinition enables Levin to rescue the machine metaphor by infusing it with cognitive and teleological flexibility — again, supporting your thesis that he redefines what it means to be a machine and uses this new definition to displace traditional mechanism with something richer and more interactive.

🔶 First Point: Reviving Teleology in Modern Biology
Subpoint:
Levin revives a form of teleological thinking that is compatible with scientific realism and empiricism. He doesn't invoke mystical final causes, but rather purposeful behavior, goal-seeking organization, and self-direction — ideas that echo Aristotelian final causes in a modern, operational context.

Evidence:
“We now have non-magical ways to understand goals, downward causation, self-reference, plasticity and much more…”

“Organicism gives us a great tool — respect for the surprising emergence of higher-order aspects of cognition (not just complexity or unpredictability); take this tool seriously and apply it fearlessly.”

“Even the simplest of systems can exert surprising effects that reach higher on the continuum of agency…”

Analysis:
Levin’s discussion of goals, downward causation, and emergent agency is a clear revival of teleological principles — not as metaphysical claims, but as testable features of complex systems. He points out that these concepts can now be studied empirically, using modern tools from cybernetics, systems theory, and developmental biology.

This return to purpose as an explanatory framework revives Aristotle’s final causes, updating them for a post-reductionist science. It’s not that systems were “designed” in any intelligent sense, but that they behave as if they have goals — a reality we ignore at the cost of explanatory power.

Tie-In to Thesis:
This directly reinforces the first part of your thesis: Levin revives teleological thinking by showing how purpose, cognition, and goal-directedness can be recognized and studied in living systems — not mystically, but mechanistically and pragmatically. It's a scientific rehabilitation of purpose, nested in the same conceptual ecosystem as Aristotle but expanded with modern tools.


Point 3/3:
Unlike Descartes’ Cartesian dualism, which splits mind and matter, Levin’s stance suggests a spectrum of mind — from simple forms in cells to complex consciousness in humans — all rooted in material processes.
