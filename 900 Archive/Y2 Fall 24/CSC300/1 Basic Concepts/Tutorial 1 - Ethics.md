# Why Understand Ethics?

- Increasingly rely on algorithms and computer automated system for decision-making in fields that involve complex social issues

  > “Socially and politically contested matters that were traditionally debated in the open are now reduced to mathematical problems with a technical solution” (Birthan, 2021)

- Outcomes of these systems are then assumed to be *side effects* of an algorithm removed from us
    - Rather than something we have direct control over

# Virtue Ethics

See [[Virtue Ethics]].

What would a virtuous person do?
- Various roles in which one is virtuous
- Various virtues that can be considered

# Utilitarianism

See [[Utilitarianism]].

- **Act Utilitarianism**
    - Action is right $\iff$ produces the greatest balance of *pleasure* over pain for the greatest number

# Case Study: MAID

- MAID is not always tied with chronic/terminal illness → often tied with poverty

## Application of virtue Ethics

A good and kind family member:
- Kindness: Help a person who seeks medically assisted death, being sensitive to needs of person who asked for help
- Respect:
    - Respect family member’s wishes

## Application of Utilitarianism

Act Utilitarianism:
- Pain family feels outweighs pleasure person who requested MAID would feel

# Relationality

- Focuses on different contexts, relationships between people
- Context of a region as well as embodiment
- More subjective
- When we do an analysis on relationality, it is a bit more messy
    - Trying to understand different factors
    - No universal standpoint; no objective truth
    - All have different subjectives, existing in the same place

# Ethics Based on Relationality

- **Knowing** that ==centers human relations==
    - e.g., When we use tech, try to understand human behaviour problems, Climate change in a region
    - At every point that we use data, we make abstractions
    - Make decisions on what data to collect, and which data to not collect → building a concept of a world which is different from reality
- **Bias** is ==not a deviation== from the “correct” description
    - Instead of leaning towards these (biased) predictions we make, it is more important to understand contexts
    - ==Prioritizing of understanding over prediction==
- CS as a practice ==alters== the social fabric
    - e.g., Important to understand environmentalists and climate change scientists as computer scientists
