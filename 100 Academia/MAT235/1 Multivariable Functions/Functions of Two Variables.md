# Function Notation

## A Monthly Payment on a Five-year Car Loan

- Payment depends on both:
    1. amount of money you borrow, and
    2. interest rate

> [!def]- If the monthly payment is \$$m$, the loan amount is \$$L$, and the interest rate is $r$%, then we express the fact that $m$ is a function of $L$ and r $by$ writing:
> $$m = f(L, r)$$

- What is the *dependent* variable?
    - $m$
- What is the *independent* variable(s)?
    - $L, r$
- What does $f$ mean?
    - The function/rule that gives the value of $m$ corresponding to the given values of $L$ and $r$

## Ways a Function of Two Variables Can Be Represented

1. Graphically
2. Numerically (table of values)
3. Algebraically (formula)

# Distance between Two Points in 3-space

Let $(x,y,z)$ and $(a,b,c)$ be two points in 3-space.
$$\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x-a)^{2} + (y-b)^{2} + (z-c)^{2}}$$

# Cross-sections and the Graph of a Function

> [!def]- Definition of **cross-section**
> For a function $f(x,y)$, the function we get by holding $x$ and letting $y$ vary is called a ==**cross-section** of $f$ with $x$ fixed==.
>
> - The *graph* of a cross-section of $f(x,y)$ with $x = c$ is the **curve**, or cross-section, we get by intersecting the graph of $f$ with the plane $x=c$.
> - We define a ==cross-section with $y$ fixed== similarly
