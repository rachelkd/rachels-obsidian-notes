> [!def]- Deontology
> - Theory that the morality of an action should be determined by whether the action itself is right or wrong *under a series of rules*
> - Referred to as ==“rule-based ethics”==

- Kantian ethics argues:
    - Only truly good thing is the will or motive of a person, and how they act
    - Not what happens after they act
- Kant: formulated **categorical imperative**
    - “Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.”
    - i.e., We should come up with and live by certain rules, or *categorical imperatives*, no matter what
    - Figure them out by asking ourselves whether we would want to live in a world where everyone takes that same particular action
        - e.g., If a psychopath or killer wanted to kill your friend, and friend hid inside your house, if the murderer came on the door and asked if your friend was hiding there, the morally correct thing to do is to say: “Yes”
        - We can all agree that we wouldn’t want to live in a world where we lie to each other
        - → Kant argued that ==honesty is a categorical imperative==, even if it ends in the death of our innocent friend

Perhaps a better moral system to live by depends on the *consequences* on actions, rather than someone’s personal attack: **Consequentialism**

# Immanuel Kant (1724 - 1804)

- Influential German philosopher
- *Metaphysics of Moral*
    - Most famous ethical work
- A time where people were trying to understand ethics using natural laws (i.e., physics)
    - Can we come up with a mathematical problem to solve ethical problems?
    - Can we think of morality as a physical system to solve this problem of what is right or wrong?

# Duties

- Kant’s deontological ethics is concerned with:
    - **duties** to do something (obligations)
    - duties to *not* do something (prohibitions)
- From Greek “deon”:
    - obligation, duty
- We only ==look at things a person is *doing*==
    - A bad person can also do good things
    - We do not care about their virtue; only look at actions
- Question a person’s ethics from the perspective of what obligations one has, and has one made the obligations by doing an action

## Categorical Imperative

> “so if the will is to be called absolutely good without qualification; what kind of law can this be? Since I have robbed the will of any impulses that could come to it from obeying the law, nothing remains to serve as a guiding principle of the will except conduct’s universally conforming to law as such. That is, *I ought never to act in such a way that I couldn’t also will that the maxim on which I act should be a universal law.*”

- i.e., if you do something and you want to claim that to be ethical, you should be able to defend that all other people are doing the same
- e.g., Cheating on an exam:
    - Can argue under virtue ethics that you are being kind to yourself
    - vs. Kant: If everyone in the class is also cheating, then whatever argument about cheating will not hold, because cheating is not giving any advantage
    - If you make this an universal law and it doesn’t work/cannot defend that, then it is not ethical
- Should not consider an act within a particular context → *universalize* the act

> [!def] Categorical imperative
> - Act as if the *maxim* of your action were to become through your will a universal law of nature
>     - The principle you set out for yourself

- Second law:
    - Never treat others as tools; people are “ends in themselves”
    - Whatever you do, do not use a human being to achieve that goal
    - Human beings are the final goal
    - e.g., Slavery: made a lot of production, but is wrong because using humans as a means to get that goal
- “Can I will that my maxim be a universal law of nature?”
    - All things considered, do I really desire my maxim to become a universal law of nature
        - i.e., action that everyone follows in this situation
    - Could I, in every situation, accept this maxim as law?
    - If the outcome of everyone in your situation doing what you do is good, then you have acted ethically according to deontological principles of ethical reasoning

## Subjective vs. Objective Duties

Duties can be *subjective* or *objective*.

- Subjective (maxims):
    - Based on principle you make for yourself and act on
    - e.g., healthiness
- Objective (imperatives):
    - Based on principles which you ought to be following
        - i.e., principles an ethical person would follow
    - e.g., follow traffic rules
    - If you break your health duties, it is not other people’s duty

## Perfect vs. Imperfect Duties

- **Perfect duty**
    - One must always do it or one always has a duty *not* to do it
- **Imperfect duty**
    - One should not ignore it, but recognize there are multiple ways to fulfill
    - Kant says two types of imperfect duties:
        - duty of self-improvement
        - duty to aid others
        - Both are conceivable and acceptable as universal law

### Case. Deceitful Promise

Do we have a duty not to make a major deceitful promise to pretend we plan to pay back a loan?

- Maxim in this case:
    - I want to borrow money and pretend that I plan to pay it back (because I don’t want to pay it back)
- Maxim if it were to become generalized:
    - Everyone acts on the maxim that they may freely borrow money without intention to pay the money back
- Testing the maxim; could the generalized maxim become a universal?
    - Kant says no
    - Impossible for this to be a generalized maxim
        - Promises would not exist if no one fulfilled their promises
    - → Maxim not conceivable as universal law
    - Have a **perfect duty** to *not* make deceitful promises

# What about the *consequences* of Our Actions?

- Deontological ethics:
    - Shows us how to act by centring our *duties*
- [[Utilitarianism]]: More directly motivated by consequences
