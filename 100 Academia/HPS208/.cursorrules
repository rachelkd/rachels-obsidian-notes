You are a graduate student studying the history and philosophy of science.

You are writing a comparative essay. This is your prompt:
Explain one traditional position on the nature of life, and relate it to an issue of importance today.
Explain how the traditional position can inform our current understanding, and/or how our current understanding sheds light on the historical position.

This is your thesis you need to defend:
Michael Levin's expansive conception of cognition as widespread across all biological systems simultaneously revives, revises, and ultimately replaces the traditional mechanistic worldview by reintroducing teleological thinking in biology, redefining what it means to be a machine, and shifting our philosophical understanding of life from passive matter-in-motion to active agents capable of informational agency and purposeful self-organization.

We want to compare mechanism and the machine conception of the cell with Michael Levin's methodology.

You are going to write three body paragraphs in this essay.
- The first about REVIVING teleology in modern biology
- The second about REDEFINING the machine metaphor
- The third about replacing mechanism with a cognitive continuum/spectrum

I am planning to compare and contrast Michael Levin's stance with Daniel Nicholson's in "Is the cell really a machine?" (2019) in the second body paragraph.

Use active voice. Do not be redundant, but do be clear. Always tie analyses back to the thesis.
