## Brief History of Development

### Categorizing the World

- First World vs. Third World
    - Looks at indicators such as: GDP, literacy rates, education, research, life expectancy, politics, democracy, etc.
- Global North vs. Global South
    - Category is correlated with First World vs. Third World
    - Global South includes: Latin America, Asia, South America, India
        - Socioeconomics and politics is not as good as the Global North
- Developed vs. Developing
    - Developing countries: Per capital is developing

> [!obs] When you try to use technologies for global development problems, you see people referring to these categories of “two worlds” a lot.

### <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Modernization</mark>

- How should we move from a Third World country to a First World country?
- About 100 years ago:
    - Movement about what life, economy, politics should look like
    - All these ways of being are determined by an overarching philosophy called ==enlightenment==
    - → Set of values that came with this ‘world-making’ process
    - Among these values came *indicators* which you can use to make a developing country → developed country
    - **Modernization** is one of them

> [!def]+ Modernization
>
> - Idea that everything needs to be faster and smaller
> - Dominant paradigm of *development*
> - Driven by an ideology of *economic development* and *dissemination of modern values*
>     - While ==ignoring local values and knowledge==
> - Indicators of ‘progress’ were observed through changes in income, education, industrialization, urbanization, diffusion of technologies, mass media, etc.
>     - e.g., How should we use mass media to mobilize the workforce; to teach modern methods of doing old work in new ways
> - Argued that this ‘development’ helped the West maintain superiority and domination in post-colonial times without relying on military power

- e.g., Farming now vs. the past
    - People used to do things by hand; formal, and labour-intensive (e.g., plowing, watering crops)
    - What if this method of farming is not efficient?
        - How should we develop tools and technology to improve some of the works associated with farming?
    - → Developed a range of technologies for how to plow, water, collect, etc.
    - All these new technologies came to modernize farming and agriculture

<!-- break -->
- Occurred largely in the 1950s-1960s
- Intended that developing countries could *copy* the West’s development
- ICT **top down development** accompanies broader economic initiatives:
    - & Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE)
        - Program ran for a year
        - Made ==educational television programming== available to rural India
        - Problem:
            - You have adopted these sets of values; you know how infrastructure should be for modern development
            - If you go to a non-developed (or rural) region in Bangladesh or India, people likely do not have the same ideals/values/lifestyle
                - → Trying to pass down your idea of modernization onto them
                - One approach of doing this was mass media
    - & Krishi Darshan
        - Programming aimed at children and farmers in India to provide instructional information
- Point:
    - Have identified some regions as non-modern and rural
    - Trying to teach them how to ‘be modern’ through adopting satellite programs and television

#### Modernization Theory

![|600](https://i.imgur.com/eHS72Hb.png)

- **Rostow’s Theory of Modernization**
    - From “The stages of economic growth: A non-communist manifesto”
    - ? How can you identify non-modern places, and how can you help them become a modern society?
    1. & Identification of traditional society
        - Limited technology
        - Static society
        - You go to these societies → Trigger the society i.e., persuade these societies to be modern
        - Transition triggered by external forces, interests, or markets
            - Go there with some vision → Communicate the ways you can be modern; how modernization can happen
    2. & Preconditions for take-off
        - Commercial exploitation of agriculture and extractive industry
        - To get to the next step:
            - ==Installation of physical infrastructure== (e.g., roads, railways, etc.), and
            - Emergence of ==social/political elite==
        - You have gone to a society → Convinced them to be modern → Made the stage for them to take-off on the road to modernization → Problem: society needs infrastructure in order to sell some sort of product/engage in market
    3. & Take-off
        - Development of a manufacturing sector
        - To get to the next step:
            - Investment in manufacturing exceeds 10 percent of national income
            - Development of modern social, economic, and political institutions
    4. & Drive to maturity
        - Development of wider industrial and commercial base
        - To get to the next step:
            - Exploitation of comparative advantages in international trade
    5. & High mass consumption
        1. People are rich now; they are selling a product to the market; good profit
        2. → Have surplus income to spend

### History of International Aid

> [!summary]+ So far:
>
> - Have identified a region or community to be modern
> - Know established theories
> - Given society a framework on how it can turn from non-modern to modern, but
> - *Modernization* involves spending ==money==
>     - for infrastructure
>     - bureaucrisies have arisen as a byproduct

> [!question] Where is the money coming from?

- **The International Monetary Fund** (IMF):
    - International organization
    - Consists of 189 countries working to foster (around the world):
        - ==Global monetary cooperation==
        - ==Secure financial stability==
        - ==Facilitate international trade==
        - ==Promote high employment and sustainable economic growth==
        - ==Reduce poverty==
- **The World Bank**
    - International financial institution that provides *loans* to countries of the world for ==capital projects==
        - e.g., Building schools (for education), hospitals (for healthcare), road infrastructure (for mobilization)

#### Some Criticisms of Foreign Aid

> [!warning] Foreign aid comes with some prices.

- Implicit pressure that organizations/countries are trying to impose in developing countries:
    - e.g., Bangladesh borrowed money from the World Bank
        - World Bank imposed some rules and regulations
        - Demanded Bangladesh to implement policies in education, road infrastructure, etc. as a “terms and conditions” for taking this loan
        - → World Bank imposed the curriculum, borrowing from the developed countries → instilled in schools and colleges
            - Education in Bangladesh was not ==connected to the local knowledge practices==, the local culture, and local values
            - Was trained into some foreign culture

> [!important]+ Most foreign aid promotes free-market economic policies
>
> - e.g., Deregulation, privatization, trade liberation
> - The aids from World Bank and IMF are *not* free
>     - It is a ‘world-making’ agenda
>     - Give money to Third World countries → In return, *colonize* their thought processes, worldviews, ways of being, what products/technologies they are using, entertainment they are consuming

- Under-representation of the Global South in the *decision-making process*
- The expansion of *bureaucratic state power*
- Often causes ==major harm== through development projects
- Does not consider the ==environment, sustainability, and traditional processes==

### Modernization

> [!summary]+ Ultimately, focus on economic development has led to the creation of **capitalist classes**, where the rich appropriate *surplus profits*, and the poor were exploited for their *labour*
>
> - **Top-down solutions** are usually insensitive to the needs and culture of local groups

> [!summary]+ ICT tech and the mass media
>
> - The *linear and unidirectional* nature of communications on these media platforms turns the masses into ==passive audiences==
> - Issues and agenda of **local populations** are rarely reflected in the mainstream discourse
>     - Space was not provided to express themselves, discuss their issues, find solutions for them

### Dependency Theory

![](https://i.imgur.com/kUEk2JQ.png)

- To describe this phenomena (of how developed countries are imposing their power, politics, and vision of the worldview into poor and under-developed countries to achieve their agendas in the global north):
    - **Dependency Theory** by Andre Gunder Frank
- There are some *cores* of development
    - Cores: Global North/developed countries
- There are the *peripheries* of development
    - Peripheries: the under-developed countries
- Semi-pheriphery
    - Developing countries, in-between the periphery and core countries
- The goods move from the core → periphery
    - From the developed countries, the goods (not just in terms of product, but entertainment, visions, politics, ideals, values)
- Resources move from the periphery → the core
    - For the core’s own development
    - e.g., Cheap labour, raw materials

## Technology-Driven Development

### One Laptop Per Child (OLPH)

- MIT Media Lab project
- If you give a laptop to a child in the Global South countries, they will be able to use the laptop to learn new skills → Accelerate their education
- Project failed in most cases:
    - Utopianism set unrealistic expectations around what the laptops should be able to accomplish
    - Vision formed by Nicolas Negroponte’s childhood/how he received his education
    - His vision, upbringing, and utopianism informed how he wanted to educate children through laptops
    - **Top-down approach** of what education is, and how education can be supported by a laptop
        - Short-sighted
        - Did not match with the ==existing educational system==
        - More ==expensive== than most of the things in their home
        - No ==repair== system available
        - Teachers received no ==training==
        - Students had ==fears== about computers
        - ==Unfamiliar educational content== to the students
        - etc.
- Was trying to make an intervention into the local system of education, which already has an established infrastructure of how the schooling system should be
    - Laptops were not considering what the issues were at hand in the local communities
    - Was a foreign device being imposed into the local education system

> [!summary] OLPH was a development program more tailored to the **interests of its funders**, than the needs of the people it was supposed to help

### Other Examples of Foreign Intervention Projects Failing

> [!example]+ The Hole in the Wall Project
>
> - Unsupervised computer-equipped kiosks in out-of-school settings
> - Aimed to promote self-driven, collaborative learning by low-income children

## Computing and Colonialism

### Traditional Colonialism

- Primarily **exploitative**
- Colonial powers controlled infrastructure, and had full control over the resources of the colonies
- Existing political, legal, economic, cultural, and social institutions are shaped by colonialism
    - e.g., India GDP was good before British colonies → Started decreasing substantially → Gained independence, and was destabilized → GDP kept decreasing due to civil wars

### Digital Colonialism

> [!question]+ Questions
>
> 1. What are challenges in transferring technology from the West to the Global South?
> 2. Why and how is such technology transfer analogous to colonialism?
> 3. What are the salient features of digital colonialism/postcolonial computing?

## Current Challenges in Technology and Development

- & Misinformation and “fake news”
    - e.g., COVID-19 misinformation
- & Misuse of social media platform
    - e.g., Genocide incited on Facebook with posts from Myanmar’s Military
        - To spread misinformation
- & Cybersecurity
    - e.g., People use technology for financial management (Central Bank of Bangladesh)
        - Hackers invaded the system in the Central Bank
        - Transferred $81 million from the Bangladeshi Reserve to another country
        - Cybersecurity software for bank was third-party; bought from another country
        - People did not know the inner-workings of this software
        - Even though there were people who were trained in finance and security, there were blindspots: e.g., this technology
        - → ==Infrastructural issue==
            - ==Build the infrastructure first, then digitize!==

#### Gig Economy: Neoliberalism

- **Gig economy**
    - A work arrangement where people are working remotely, less work hours, more freelance
    - Using digital platforms for doing this work
    - Trying to make work hours flexible, autonomous, want to focus on task-based work
    - Made it easier for recruiter to find recruits
    - e.g., Uber, Airbnb
- Problems with gig economy
    - A lot of the people working on these platforms are coming from Global South countries
    - Research shows that these workers are being *exploited* by the recruiter
        - Not being paid a fair wage for their labour
        - Issues of harassment and ranking the workers on platform

## What Now?

- Technology is not inherently bad. What do we do?

### Non-economic Models of Development

> “Poverty is not just a lack of money; it is not having the capability to realize one’s full potential as a human being.”
> — Amartya Sen

- **Human** development approach
- **Sustainable** development approach

#### Participatory Approach

- People should not be **passive recipients** of developmental efforts — they should be involved at every stage
- Helps determine the necessary development and enables them to be self-reliant in resolving their own issues
- Framework introduced with Parlo Friere’s work in the 1970s: *Pedagogy of the Oppressed*

#### Sustainable Development

- Meeting **human development** goals while simultaneously sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depend

### Development in Tech: ICTD

- Community media platforms managed by **grassroots communities** in a *participatory manner* are known for embodying this approach
- Inventions aim to *empower* communities to be able to create/share their own media
    - Communities have diverse information norms and needs which are not easily met by mainstream media playforms controlled by outsiders/elite
- As stores are told, traditional wisdom is shared → People can enter into a dialogue about the issues affecting them on these platforms
    - → Set the processes of community empowerment in motion

#### Examples

> [!example]+ Gram Vaani
>
> - Mobile-based community media platform
> - Relies on validated user-generated content to share local news and important information
>     - e.g., Local employment, subsidized food grain, health, agriculture, etc
> - Government/stakeholders use this platform to spread awareness about welfare schemes
> - Community members can use it for making local announcements on developmental and cultural events, fairs, and local functions

> [!example]+ Video Volunteers
>
> - Participatory video-based community media platform operating primarily in India
> - Helps local community members learn to create audiovisual media that allows them to choose which information is to be conveyed and reported on
> - “Community correspondents” are trained to share about their own communities

### Accessing the Effectiveness of Tech Initiatives

- **Technology-centric** vs. **Community-centric**
- **Top-down design** vs. **Bottom-up design**

<!-- break -->

- Why technology initiatives fail:
    - Failure to involve beneficiaries and users
    - Rigidity in plementation
    - Failure to learn from local environments
    - Ignoring local institutional capacities
- How might we design better technology:
    - Utilize people-centered frameworks that reflect social complexities
    - Explore and acknowledge participants’ personal values and goals

## Tutorial

### Post Colonialism

> [!def]+ Postcolonialism
>
> - The historical period or state of affairs representing the aftermath of Western colonialism
>     - Legacies of colonialism
>     - Project to reclaim and rethink the history and agency of people subordinated under various forms of imperialism

- Signals a possible future of overcoming colonialism,
    - yet new forms of domination or subordination can come in the wake of such changes,
    - including new forms of global empire

#### Digital Colonialism

- Poses questions of data and technological control and power, and
    - Purposes for which it is used
- While neocolonialism is ongoing in the material world, the tehcnological world replicates many of the same structures, issues, and consequences, scaling existing inequalities but in a digital world

#### Postcolonial Computing

- Has grown in the past 20-ish years
- Asking questions more than investigating
- **Postcolonial Computing**
    - A way of asking questions, a mode of investigating and a form of conversation
    - Focus on the *whole* and everyone involved
        - e.g., Designers, planners, makers, objects they shape
- Aims to broaden the conversation without relying on *dualisms*
    - e.g., Developed/developing, Traditional/scientific, colonial/post-colonial
- Postcolonial interdisciplinary practices can produce insights in all disciplines
- Lots of nuances within places → Result of this open nature of technology

#### Tactics

1. When we see a techno-scientific object, we investigate its contingency not only locally but in the ==infrastructures, assemblages, and political economies== that are the conditions of its possibility
    1. Would it work in a vacuum? What is needed for it to be successful?
    2. Why is this technology so successful in a country?
        1. Due to political factors
        2. Local factors
        3. etc.
    3. We always want to work at these margins
        1. Important: Find communities and people who are marginalized and left out
2. When we see ==claims of inherent technological and cultural difference==, we apply **science and technology studies** methods *symmetrically* to both the technology and culture at hand
    1. Why it is being used, how it is being used
    2. Breaking down boundaries to make a more complex and more complete picture
3. When techno-scientific knowledge appears to ==diffuse form higher to lower concentrations==, we look for ==signs of the opposite==
4. The **universal model**, the view from everywhere, and the voice of the center remain **radically incomplete**
