# Primary Impact: Making Technology

## Materials

> [!def]+ Materials
>
> - The materials that compose technologies:
>     - Do not come out of a vacuum
>     - Do not go out of existence once they are done being used
> - & Tracing the origin and end-points of devices that we use can ==illuminate aspects/injustices of the supply/value chain== that are previously unknown

> [!question] Where do the materials for electronic information technologies/devices come from? Is the history of these materials “clean?”

> [!question] When a device breaks down, what happens to it? Where do the broken parts go?

## Raw Material Extraction: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Silicon</mark>

- Critical material for **transistors** (and motherboards)
- Sourced from quartz ($SiO_{2}$)
- Must be *pure* for transistors
- Major source:
    - Unimin, North Carolina, US
- Industry at Unimin is **monopolized**
    - One company has bought most of the land there and have not made silicon business available for any other competition
    - Have strong lobby with State and Federal governments
    - Lots of complaints about using ==local labour in an unethical way==
    - Complaints about labour exploitation of the local communities
    - Business executives do not care: Supplying the fuel for Silicon Valley → Feeding America for a long time
- Extraction techniques remain a secret
    - Do not go by the law of the State
    - Can do that because of their wealth and power on Silicon Valley

## Raw Material Extraction: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Cobalt</mark>

- Vital for lithium-ion batteries
- 35,000 to 40,000 miners are children in Democratic Republic of Congo
    - **Child labour**
    - Huge issue in Congo
- Miners face dangerous, unprotected conditions
    - Not trained, bad mining facilities
- Lack of maps, drills, safety gear
- Mining exposes people to toxic metals
    - → Health problems are very common in this industry
    - e.g., Skin, respiratory problems

> [!important]+ When we think about changing the world with technology, we need to consider injustices towards marginalized communities during manufacturing

- Around 10-25% of cobalt come globally vs. 60% directly from the DRC
- Wealth does not benefit miners
- Continues modern colonialism, slavery

## Raw Material Extraction: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Coltan</mark>

- Tantalum, niobium used in **capacitors**
    - Extracted from Coltan ores
- DRC militia control minerals
- Coltan trade is *unregulated*
    - Directly contract militia groups to give $x$ amount of Coltan by some date for $\$y$
- Forced and child labour by militias
- Smelting occurs in USA, Germany, China, Kazakhstan

## Raw Material Extraction

- Mining *harms* the environment
    - → Act of ecosystem destruction, pollution
    - <u>Oklahoma:</u> Town had to be evacuated due to mining
    - <u>DRC:</u> Endangered species are hunted, agriculture land is ruined
    - <u>Bolivia:</u> Lithium mining pollution

## Manufacturing: Toxic Elements

- The **manufacturing process** that occurs in the assembly of technologies often has a significant ==negative environmental impact==
- Many chemicals needed to produce computer chips are known **carcinogens**
    - i.e., Can cause cancer
    - Many being released into the air as emissions and contaminate local groundwater

## Manufacturing: Urban Sprawl

- **Urban sprawl**:
    - Manufacturing company → Lots of engineers will relocate → Place changes, urban spaces increase
    - Rural, natural spaces are destructed
- Urbanization harms local species
- Fertile land lost
- Santa Clara Valley converted
- Air quality worsens
- Smog, traffic, health issues

## Manufacturing: Emissions

- Manufacturing is a **major emissions source**
- Apple:
    - 74% of emissions comes from manufacturing
- Smelting, chip production release greenhouse gas emissions
- Factories in low-income regions:
    - Sometimes unregulated
    - Producing lots of emissions every day
- Environmental impact on poorer populations

# Secondary Impact: Using Technology

- Impact on the environment while *using* technology
- Story of negative impact on environment does not end at mining and manufacturing; it continues

## Computing: Emissions

- Computing produces 5% of GHG emissions
- Major source of GHGE in 2010:
    - Data centers, communication networks, and desktop computers
- Compared to 2020:
    - People now store less things in their own devices and rely on the cloud → More demand for data centers
    - Went from 33% relative contributions of GHGE of ICT categories to 45%
    - Smartphones make up 11% vs. 4% in 2010
- Data centers require electricity, water (for cooling)
    - Produce heat, situated in colder climates
- Communication networks (e.g., social media apps, messaging apps):
    - Every time you scroll down on your news feed → Burning energy
    - Every time you send a message → Burning energy

<!-- break -->
- Demand for computing hardware, software, services, electricity is growing
- GHG emissions footprint for ICT industry is *steadily growing*
- Landscape of which devices/architectures are contributing to emissions is shifting

## Generative AI’s Energy Use

- [p] Produce 310-2900 times less $CO_{2}$ per image than human creator
- [c] Uses 33 times more energy than machines running task-specific software
    - If you are using Photoshop to create an image, you will definitely burn some (computing) energy
    - If you use gAI to create same image, it will search a lot of things, run huge DL network to create an output → Requires 33 times more energy
- Increases electricity demand
    - May somewhat help environment
    - But still uses electricity, which brings some emissions

## Power Consumption: Data Centers

- **Data centers** (especially those that support cloud computing and large tech corporations):
    - Require exorbitant amounts of energy and electricity to power them
- Electricity use has stayed relative stable over past years
    - Due to hyper-scale data centers
        - Technology advancements
- Nevertheless projected that data centers likely to constitute a significant portion of energy demand
    - Sizeable data centers consuming the same amount of electricity that a small city would need
- With many tech companies trying to use renewable energy, still not the dominant source of electricity
    - Many companies are still using fossil fuels
    - Invest in fossil fuel companies → Fossil fuel companies invest back in tech companies

## Power Consumption

- Any peripheral support that is required to maintain and support the tech supply chain would also be considered in the scope of emissions contributions
    - e.g., Office networks, telecom operators
- As data center impact grows, so does smartphone, tablet, notebook, and other tech device use
    - All will have a more significant impact in the future

<!-- break -->
- Computing Devices
    - Desktops
    - Notebooks
    - LCD Displays
    - CRT Displays
    - Smart Phones
    - Tablets
- Data Centers
    - Servers
    - Communication
    - Storage
    - Cooling and power
- Communication Networks
    - Customer premises access equipment (CPAE)
    - Office networks
    - Telecom operator
    - Cooling and power
- Other ICT equipment is out of scope
    - Including TVs, set-top boxes, printers

## Aside: Companies and Government

- Relationships between companies and governments are complex
    - Yes, they might be harming the environment, but
    - Also bringing jobs and money to the economy → Governments might not want to impose environmental regulations to stop these companies

## An Individual Tech Artifact: Life Cycle Impact

- **Production Energy** (PE)
    - Energy use that includes a full inventory of the materials and processes involved
    - From the material extraction all the way to shipment to the final customer
- **Use Phase Energy** (UPE)
    - Annual energy use/consumption of computing devices
- **Useful Life** (UL)
    - Average length of time that a computing device should be or is actually used for
    - Variable estimates
- **Lifecycle Annual Footprint** (LAF)
    - Defined as the sum of the Use Phase Energy and Production Energy divided by the product Useful Life

> [!note]+ Ultimately, as each variable is subject to extreme variation and change in the way of new innovative development and also technological use trends,
>
> - It is hard to gauge the GHG/Carbon emissions impact of technologies

# Tertiary Impact: Discarding Technology

## E-Waste

- Discarded technologies contain ==numerous hazardous materials== that are *released* into the air, and seep into groundwater, affecting local populations
- With the majority of e-waste shipped abroad, the ==environmental impact is most strongly felt by the Global South/developing countries==
    - Places do not have good facilities for electronic recycling

## What Can We Do?

### Need: Policy

- ==Require data centers to use renewable energy==
    - Encourage tech corporations who are doing it already
- Policy to ==combat planned obsolescence==
    - Apple: When they released new phones, they would make old phones not work as well → Force people to discard tech and buy new devices
    - Tech companies (e.g., Samsung, Apple) have already been fined by the EU for PO strategies
- Force providers and companies to provide more room for repair of devices and encourage the longer use of them
    - NGOs are working to enact legislative changes that would ensure longer functioning and use of technologies
    - e.g., Spain’s Friends of the Earth (Amigos de la Tierra)
    - **Right to repair**:
        - Some companies void warranty if you open up devices, use different screws that require unconventional tools
        - Make it difficult for customer to repair by themselves

### Need: Increased Transparency

- **Accountability** is difficult to maintain as resource extraction, component manufacturing, technological assembly, and ultimate sale of the technology can occur in different places across the globe
- ==Calls for increased transparency== in the supply chain can force organizations to be *accountable* for their business practices without dodging accountability
- Organizations (e.g., Carbon Disclosure Project) encourage corporations to voluntarily submit emissions data
    - Aims to make environmental reporting and risk management a business norm

### Need: Green IT

- **Green IT**
    - Refers to environmentally sound IT
    - Study and practice of designing, manufacturing, using, and disposing of computers, servers, and associated subsystems
- Involves a holistic approach:
    - Target all areas of IT industry and entire lifecycle of IT devices
- Changing personal and corporate behaviour to incorporate more environmentally sound practices
    - e.g., Screensavers, powering systems off when not in use, etc.
- Using IT itself for environmental sustainability to bring awareness to environmental issues
    - e.g., Modelling and AI to determine issues and trends
    - If you can justify your use, then that is good

# Conclusion

- There are emissions and ecological/environmental impact at every level of computing
- Primary impact:
    - Resource extraction
    - Manufacturing
- Secondary impact:
    - Corporate computing: Virtual/cloud servers
    - Coordinated computing: Bitcoin
    - Personal computing: Your tech use
- Tertiary impact:
    - E-waste

<!-- break -->
- There is a systemic externalization of harms onto communities and ecosystems in impoverished areas far from the affluent districts where the technologies are bought and utilized
    - When we buy computers, we do not see the harms on people/places/environment
    - e.g., Resource mining in Global South, factories located in impoverished areas, e-waste being sent to Global South
