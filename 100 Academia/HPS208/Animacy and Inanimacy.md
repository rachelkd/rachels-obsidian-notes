# Animacy and Inanimacy

> [!question]+ Is a virus alive? What about a candle flame?
> - Students proposed:
>     - Gray area
>     - Viruses need a human host to reproduce
>         - But humans also need something and a good environment to reproduce
>     - Metabolism
>         - But candles seem to have a sort of metabolism
>     - Homeostasis needed to be considered alive
>     - Even goal-oriented?
>         - Candles do not seem goal-oriented
>     - Surely reproduction cannot be the only requirement, because candles can reproduce under the correct conditions

> [!question]+ What is alive and what is not alive?
> - How do you draw the line, and how do you identify examples

## Hylozoism

> “All things are full of gods. The magnet is alive; for it has the power of moving iron”
> — Thales

- In Western tradition, pre-Socrates:
    - Had hylozoism
- In old European tradition:
    - ==Self-moving== was one of the main criteria for being alive

![|446x309](https://i.imgur.com/XPC2Xdl.png)

- **Hylozoism**
    - Refers to the idea that ==all matter is imbued with life==
    - e.g., Sun, moon, wind
- Distinguish hylozoism from **panpsychism**
    - Which says all matter has *mind*
- If you are a panpsychist, you might be a hylozoist
    - If you are a hylozoist, you can maybe disagree with panpsychism
    - i.e., Can say that things are living, but maybe not intelligent forces; life is just everywhere

## Aristotle

- Aristotle
    - Had a more strict picture of what it means to be alive
    - Claimed the essence of being alive is the ability to ==“resist internal and external perturbations”==
        - i.e., If something knocks you off your course, you are about to right yourself somehow
        - Something like the *homeostasis* criteria suggested in the [[#^655df5|motivation question]]
- Attributed this capacity to the **nutritive soul**
    - Common to all living things
    - Instinctive soul that animals have
    - Rational soul that man has
- & Believed the barrier between the living and non-living was *==permeable==*
    - Something could go from non-living to living very straightforwardly via the **spontaneous generation** of life

### Spontaneous Generation in Aristotle and beyond

- Modern biology believes spontaneous generation happened at least once on this planet
    - i.e., Some non-living system became a living system, and then we all evolved from there
- Until the 19th-century, the belief was that this happened regularly

> [!info]+ European tradition held that living things come from non-living matter until about the 19th-century
> - e.g., Frogs spontaneously generate from mud
> - Snakes generate from a decomposing human spine

- Pliny the Elder
    - Explained that a particular wind — the *genitalis spiritus mundi* — could impregnate sheep, tigers, vultures, etc.
    - (Natural History XVI.93)

## Modern Definitions of Life

- Unclear how many attempts have been made to define life
    - But number is ==at least in the hundreds==
    - Very likely in the thousands
- No consensus whatsoever about which definitions of life are correct
- Focus on a wide range of properties:
    - e.g., from **structural features**, to **metabolic**, to **reproduction**, **genetic**, **complexity**, etc.

> [!question]+ Why do we want a definition of life?
> - Some arguments from wanting a definition of life come from ==astrobiology==
>     - If you go to alien planet and see a thing, you want to ask: Is this alive?
> - Some versions from environmental ethics:
>     - Have been talking from a *sentiental view*: We have moral obligations to something if it is sentient
>     - Also a **biocentrist** view:
>         - You have responsibility for anything that is alive
>         - → Having a definition of what it means to be alive is helpful

> [!attention]+ Some authors have argued that whole project is a big mistake from the beginning
> Machery (2012) argues:
>
> - Wasting time even trying to define life
> - & Definitions are either *folk* definitions, or a *scientific* theory
>     - If they are folk definitions, then no agreement is possible
>         - People can just disagree
>         - “Folk definition” refers to people just trying to figure out what the word “life” means
>             - Sociological and linguistic analysis
>     - If scientific, then they are useless
>         - A scientific theory happens within a scientific definitions
>         - Different disciplines need difference definitions
>         - e.g., Biochemist definition of life probably involves carbon, or metabolism
>             - If you are an astrobiologist, definition is probably more broad; does not include those features
>         - Different disciplines have different interests and goals
>         - Definition has to meet the interesting goals of the discipline
>         - Not going to boil down to one definition

^fee128

- Not converging to answer about the definition of life at the moment

## The Extent of Life

> [!abstract]+ Suppose we give up on one clean, crisp definition of life.
> We can nonetheless have a conversation about which things in the world are or are not alive.

### Main Reading: Our Knowledge is Not Primitive (Geniusz)

> [!note]- Glossary and table of important terms

>         - Mostly just colonization and how to decolonize
> - We focus on Chapter 2, particularly section titled “Categories of Animate and Inanimate within Inaadiziwin”

#### The Anishinaabeg

- **Anishinaabeg**
    - Plural of Anishinaabe
    - Group of First Nations that live in Canada and US
    - Group includes the Ojibwe, Chippewa, Odawa, Potawatomi, Algonquin, and Missisauga among others

> [!caution]+ Geniusz cautions that what she writes is from her own specific experience within this *broad* collection of cultures
> - May not apply in exactly the same way to all Anishinaabe teachings

#### Forced Assimilation

> [!question]+ Why is Geniusz attempting to do this reconstruction? Why does she have to do it in the first place?
> - Historically, in Canada, a lot of Indigenous culture was destroyed on purpose

- Not a conspiracy; this was the explicit stated policy of the British and then Canadian government for more than a century
- Many strategies were used:
    - Including compelled removal of Indigenous children to residential schools
    - Forced sterilizations
- Helps to explain both Geniusz’s project
    - & Establishing the tools for cultural revitalization
- Helps explain why so much of what is known is incomplete

#### The Charge of “Animism”

> [!summary]+ One of the beliefs that was the target of active suppression:
> - Indigenous view of which parts of the world are **animate**, and which are **inanimate**

- **Animism**
    - Term anthropologists used for Indigenous worldviews since essentially the invention of anthropology
    - Coined by **==Edward Burnett Taylor==** (1832-1917)
    - Sometimes credited as founder of cultural anthropology as a scientific discipline

##### Evolutionism

- Taylor subscribed to **evolutionism** in the sense defined by Herbert Spencer
- Spencer:
    - ~ Argued that universe as a whole was *evolving* in that it was ==progressing towards greater heterogeny and complexity==
        - Applied to everything from stars to societies
        - e.g., Stars coalescing into planetary systems, species evolving, individuals growing, to individual psychology forming, to societies changing over time
    - Believed all these examples undergo the same type of evolution, which is
        - Moving away from a homogeneous, undifferentiated state to a heterogenous, having different kinds of parts, all complexly interacting with each other
    - Worked with this basic belief into his analysis of cultures
        - Idea that they went through various stages of development
- This is a thesis in biology and physics
    - But in our case, it is also a *social thesis*
    - Societies are getting more complex
    - → Can identify those simple, crude societies
        - Then identify societies further down the evolutionary path
        - e.g., the colonialist-Brit society

##### Animism

- If you think that societies are evolving towards higher and higher complexity, and that is good, then you really think that you can/should take over every culture and replace those cultures with your culture
- Edward Burnett Taylor:
    - Was a subscriber to evolutionism
    - Argues that every culture begins from a-kind-of religious starting point: **animism**
        - i.e., Believing that the ==world is widely inhabited by life==, and that ==life is widely animated by spirits==
    - Describes this as (apparently) universal view of “lesser races”
        - Which then evolves into the “higher worldviews” of — for example — the British

> [!info]+ Term *animism* has fallen out of favour in anthropology
> - Mostly because it is an insult disguised as a scientific term
> - To call a culture *animist* is to say:
>     - They attribute animacy incorrectly i.e., too widely

> [!abstract]+ Some attempts have been made to revive the term (e.g., “neo-animism”)
> - Basically using the same term, but do not mean it as an insult to say that this viewpoint is wrong
> - Wilkinson (2017):
>     - Argues that these are ill-conceived
>
> Wilkinson, D. (2017). Is there such a thing as animism?. Journal of the American Academy of Religion, 85(2), 289-311.

- ? Who should regard themselves as believing in the *supernatural*?
    - Should not believe in the supernatural
        - If you think ghosts exist, then you believe that ghosts are a part of the natural world
        - If you think magic is real, then you believe that magic is part of the natural world
    - To call a belief supernatural assumes that someone is wrong about that belief
    - No one should call themselves as a believer of the supernatural
- & Similarly, no one should self-describe as an animist
    - Just have different attributions of what parts of the world are alive, sentient, intelligent, or having a spirit

> [!summary]+ Geniusz spends most of the book talking about Anishinaabe botanical knowledge
> - Explains that understanding Anishinaabe botanical knowledge requires ==understanding a densely interconnected set of other parts of the Anishinaabe worldview==

### Animacy and Personhood

> [!quote]+ Geniusz (2009, p. 56)
> “Inaadiziwin \[psychology or way of being, in this case of the Anishinaabe] divides the world into categories of animate beings and inanimate objects differently than other philosophies. \[…] Keewaydinoquay says that things such as rocks, trees, and plants, which are considered to be inanimate by the dominant society, are considered animate within Anishinaabe philosophy.”

- Keewaydinoquay Peschel:
    - Scholar
    - Author of sources regarded as the least-colonized tellings from Indigenous cultures
- This is more than just attributing the status of “living thing” to a tree
    - Presumably, everyone does this
- & Rather, it attributes **personhood**

#### Gathering Plant Materials

> [!tldr] Geniusz describes the “Protocols for Gathering Materials from Plants and Trees” (p.60-63)

- First:
    - An offering of *asemaa* (*nicotina rustica*) is given to the plant
    - Sometimes by digging a small hole and placing a bit near the roots
- Then:
    - A request and explanation is given to the plant
- One asks permission to gather some of it, explaining why one ==needs== it
- One also makes ==assurance== to the plant
    - That only as much as needed will be collected, and
    - Enough will be left that its descendants can survive
- If collecting a number of same species, this may only need to be done once per visit

#### Songs

- In addition to offerings and requests for permission:
    - Some plant materials require **songs** for gathering specific materials
- Nanabozho:
    - A half-spirit/half-man
    - Instructed the Anishinaabe to sing a particular song while root-gathering
        - (p. 62)
- Additionally, songs may be sung when specific medicines are prepared
    - To encourage the appropriate spirits to offer their help

#### Listening for a Response

> [!question]+ How do you know that you have permission?
> - Despite providing an offering and asking permission, etc.:
>     - Permission for collecting may not be given

- % This is a feature of all consent between persons
    - If there is no possibility of refusal, consent is not really possible
- Examples what consent looks like are given on p. 64:
    - One person is trying to gather a specific plant
        - Have done the offering, request
        - Then a bee flies into the flower and drops dead
        - → Keewaydinoquay interprets this as a “no”
    - Another story about Keewaydinoquay gathering cat tails
        - Describes it being unusually hard to collect them
        - Slippery, waters were rough
        - Things just feel off → Being told that cat tails are not supposed to be collected right now
- ! The description makes it sound unlikely that there are any necessary and sufficient signs for refusal
    - Unlikely to be able to boil down “permission” and “refusal” to a simple, direct set of rules
    - Just like with consent between humans
    - Need context

### Permission and Plant Medicine

> [!info]+ There is another reason why “consent” and asking is important
> - Particularly in the context of **plant medicine**

- Genuisz gives several recipes for plant medicines in the Appendix
    - e.g., A tea foliage, a wart cream, and a skin balm based primarily on *Giizhikaatig* (white cedar)
- These are mechanically very straightforward recipes
    - However, if a non-Indigenous person were to follow these recipes, they would not be making a Anishinaabe plant medicine
    - & The asking and relating to the plant as a person is a necessary part of preparing the medicine
        - Without that, the medicine will not do its job

> [!important]+ Relating to the tree as a person in the right ways is a necessary condition for making these medicines
> - Without this *personhood*, they lack something essential

### The Grandfathers

> [!info] Similarly, rocks are regarded as persons
> - Sometimes referred to as the **Grandfathers**

- When a person wants to use a rock for something, the same sort of *permission* must be sought
    - Asking permission, explaining what you are doing

> [!example]+ Geniusz gives the example of breaking them apart into pieces to build a pathway
> - Need the same basic attitude of humble respect

## Life, Death, and Respect

- In previous weeks, we were concerned about the view that plants may be sentient
    - ? What are we supposed to eat then?
- You are asking for permission to crush the rocks into pieces to transform them in a deep way
    - Similarly, you can ask animals for permission to take their lives and eat them, and use their body parts for making things
- In [[Hindu Environmental Ethics|Hinduism]] and Jainism:
    - Assumption we made was: If something is a person, you are not allowed to kill it and eat it
    - To the extent that something has sentience, it is immoral to kill it and eat it
- ! This assumption seems to not be shared in the Anishinaabe worldview
    - Anishinaabe regard animals, plants, rocks, rivers, etc. as persons, deserving of respect
        - Also regarded as sources of food, clothing, tools, medicine, etc.
    - & Can actually ask for that permission and receive it and have done nothing wrong
    - It is immoral to *exploit* and *waste* persons, and do stuff without their consent

> [!example]+ Geniusz provides an account of the ceremony held for a killed bear
> - To convince spirit to return to the village and tell other bears to allow themselves to be killed
>     - These people were respectful enough that you should allow yourselves to be killed
> - The idea of it it was: The bear allowed itself to be killed
>     - Consented to give up its body
>     - Spirit survives the death of the body
>     - & The bear agrees to this
>
> (p. 58)

- This is how you get a *culture* where:
    - & Personhood is attributed widely
        - i.e., Plants and animals are regarded as having full personhood deserving of respect and care
    - & But they still eat meat
    - Quite different from the traditions looked at so far from [[Hindu Environmental Ethics|Hinduism]] and [[Hindu Environmental Ethics#Ahimsa in Jainism|Jainism]]

> [!example]+ This attitude that sometimes the risk or actuality of death may be worthwhile is ==not exclusive to non-humans==
> - Geniusz explains:
>     - Although the Anishinaabe would never be foolish enough to randomly experiment with plants to see if they were medicine,
>     - Sometimes ==elders would volunteer to test== out a hypothesized cure in times of serious need

- Also learn about this from first spirits who instructed them, dreams, or animals
    - Provides a formed hypothesis → Then test it
    - In the same way that science is not just guess-and-check
- Human experiment of a type that modern medicine would probably not
    - First would sacrifice a bunch of unwilling animals, then test it on humans
- In Anishinaabe culture:
    - & The idea that a “death of the body is morally justified” seems to apply to humans as well
    - There are ways of relating to an animal such that it is ethical to kill and eat them and use their bodies to do stuff

## The Balance of the World

- Anishinaabe philosophy considers the **balance of the world** as a primary ethical good

> [!def]+ Balance of the world
> - All elements of nature have a role to play
> - Through their *interconnection*, each ==depends== on the others
> - Things are relating to each other in the proper sort of ways

- Genuisz provides an account of the *order* in which various parts of the world were created:
    - First rocks, weather, and spirits
    - Then plants and trees
    - Then non-human animals
    - Then humans
    - (p. 57)
- & Only the first layer of creation can exist without the other layers
    - Rocks, weather, spirits
    - Would persist even without plants, animals, humans, and so on
    - Do not get to have plants without a place for them to grow
    - Do not get to have animals without the ability to eat plants
    - Do not get to have humans without the rest of the biosphere
- & Without the other layers, they would be incomplete
    - Even the first layer
    - Each one depends on the previous one
    - Rocks, weather, spirits would be regarded as incomplete without everything else
    - Without the rest of the world, they would not have the relationships to put them into the right place in the balance of nature
- % If this was Aristotle, he would say that this places humans as the most important part of the world
    - Likely not the picture that this story is giving about the world
    - If this order of creation seems to humans ‘on top’, see p. 127-136 to remedy that mistaken impression
        - Story about animals looking at humans and thinking humans are not doing well

## What Should We Think?

- This is not to say that you should believe the Anishinaabe worldview
- These are little bits and pieces of a worldview
    - Not the integrated thing itself
    - Splitting off individual bits of a complex webs of practices, stories, and relationships, and evaluating them as isolated pieces, is silly
- There is a *asymmetry* of knowledge
    - You are not going to get this in a deep way just from looking at the bits and pieces
- But we can talk a bit about the practical results of this and related worldviews

## Mistaking a Garden for a Paradise

- Charles Mann:
    - & Argues that Europeans who came to the Americas from 1492 onward made a profound *mistake* in interpreting what they say
- Universally reported astonishment at how rich and full of life the continent was
    - Talked about the place being teeming with wildlife, plants that are good to eat
    - Thought that it was a good thing that the Indigenous did not do too much and left it as the way it is
- Looked like a natural bounty to them
    - i.e., Something that just spontaneously happened
- Mann argues that:
    - & They are actually seeing was a millennia of careful stewardship
    - Walked into a garden, and thought “how beautiful” and spontaneous it was
        - Same thing as walking into someone’s home and thinking how amazing it is that the home is clean and the dishes are put away
    - They worked really hard to make this continent a nice place to live

### Land Management

- One common tool for land management among various Indigenous groups was **controlled fires**
    - Intentionally starting fires that burned away dry brush and undergrowth was a widely used technique of land management
    - Prevents a huge, raging wildfire
- Mann argues that:
    - The fact that the great plains are plains and not forested is probably a human-induced way of the landscape
    - People were frequently doing controlled burns
        - Partly to allow grazing animals to have somewhere to graze
        - Herds of mason and bison when Europeans showed up
        - Was not by accident
            - People were specifically and intentionally doing controlled burns

> [!quote]+ “Sometime in the first millennium A.D., the \[Haudenosaunee] who had burned undergrowth to facilitate grazing began systematically replanting large belts of woodland, transforming them into orchards for fruit and mast […] From today’s perspective, the success of the transition is striking. It was so sweeping and ubiquitous that early European visitors marveled at the number of nut and fruit trees and the big clearings \[which allowed animals to graze] with only a dim apprehension that the two might be due to the same human source.”
> (Mann p.301-302)

> [!quote]+ “One reason that Bartram failed to understand the artificiality of what he saw was that the surgery was almost without scars; the new landscape functioned smoothly. With few of the overreaches that plagued English land management”
> (Mann p.302)

- Mann notes:
    - % European environmentalist movements often frame the Indigenous relationship with the land as **non-interference**
        - Mistake that the Europeans made when they first arrived in the Americas
        - Mistake that persists in many quarters
        - Mistake is the idea that the Indigenous did not do anything with nature and left it alone
        - All of the evidence suggests that is not true
            - Rather, they had relationships with the rest of the biosphere
    - About the same as suggesting that we should have a policy of non-interference with our families and friends
        - Rather than one of close interaction, mutual respect, and care
