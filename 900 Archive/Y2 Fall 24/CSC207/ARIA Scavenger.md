**Talk to people representing their company and find out what is their company’s main product(s) or service(s). Alternatively you can find this on their websites. Write the names of at least two companies’ and their major product(s) or service(s) here.**

Cohere is a technology firm that focuses on developing AI-enterprise solutions by implementing advanced LLMs and natural language processing. Their flagship product is Command, which is a generative language model designed for enterprise use. It can do tasks like content generation, text summarization, and data categorization.

PhenoTips is a medical genetics software company that provides a Genomic Health Record platform. It can be used to diagnose patients with phenotype-based gene and disease suggestions and generate complete pedigree charts.

**Find out how someone got their current job in the tech industry. Did they apply to the company directly or through a job website or something else? Describe how they did it.**

I spoke with a software engineer online who shared that they landed their current role through a combination of LinkedIn networking and a referral. They explained that while many tech jobs are posted on platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and company websites, most tech roles are filled through referrals and networking. They got their position by first connecting with current employees at their target company through LinkedIn, engaging with their posts, and eventually getting coffee with one of them. This led to an internal referral, which significantly increased their chances of getting an interview.

**Locate two tech-related research projects that you find interesting. Describe them here.**

- Interactive Projection Mapping (Arthur Gao, David Zhou, Rumaisa Chowdhury)
    - This project introduces an innovative educational technology that modernizes traditional classroom dioramas through projection mapping technology. Inspired by traditional shoebox dioramas and building upon existing research in animatronics and classroom technology, the system transforms static displays into dynamic, interactive storytelling platforms.
- Automatic Parcellation of the Human Consciousness
    - Researchers Jack Pitcher and Dehanquan Kong employ machine learning and quantum computing techniques to investigate the structural organization of the human claustrum, a brain region linked to consciousness. Their research addresses the inconsistencies in previous manual segmentation attempts by implementing two innovative computational approaches: the K Means Quantum Genetic Algorithm (KMQGA) and WNet, an unsupervised deep learning model. Both methods revealed a consistent core-shell structure in the claustrum. This data-driven approach suggests a potentially universal core-shell organization of the claustrum, contributing to our understanding of consciousness and brain structure.

**Ask someone who is currently working at a tech company what advice they have for someone just starting out. Alternatively, find an article or blog post with such advice. What is that advice?**

One piece of advice is to create projects. It’s important to build a portfolio of projects that solve actual problems. It does not need to be an entire project either: you can also contribute to open-source projects on Github. It’s also important to document your work and progress in READMEs, so other people know what you did and what your product is for and how to use it.

**Ask a different person (not the previous one) which (if any) university courses, college courses, and/or additional certifications they found to be most useful in their day-to-day work and in getting their current job. What are they?**

Certifications in DevOps tools like AWS can definitely add to your resume. Otherwise, technical skills should stand out in projects. Courses in Operating Systems, Computer Graphics, and Compilers are also important.

**After filling in answers to the previous questions, which area(s) of the tech industry look most interesting to you? Why?**

I’m interested in computer graphics. I found the interactive projection mapping project at ARIA to be quite compelling; I am very passionate about STEM education. I think that projection mapping has beneficial applications in education that will get children and high school students excited about STEM subject matters. Additionally, I enjoy seeing creative projects come out of computer technology.
