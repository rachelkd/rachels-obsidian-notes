# Strange Agents

## Introduction

- Emma Sigworth:
    - PhD student for IHPST
    - Fascinated with Michael Levin’s work
    - Current responsibility in her own dissertation process to understand Levin better

> [!abstract]+ Last week: The **Living and Nonliving and Anishinaabeg Animisms**
> - Discussed the distinction between living and non-living entities processes
> - How is that distinction understood differently by different people?
> - What does it mean to be alive, what kinds of things are alive, and how should we treat them because they are alive?

> [!abstract]+ This week: **Cognition and Life**
> - Franisek Baluska & Michael Levin, “On Having no Head: Cognition Throughout Biological Systems”, 2016
> - Central thesis:
>     - & All biological systems — at any level of organization — are cognitive agents

- Arguably, this is a wild claim
    - ? How do the authors defend this position?
    - ? *Why* do the authors defend this position?

> [!goal]+ Think about how Baluska and Levin discuss the nature of life and nature of cognition
> - Both Baluska and Levin have distinct scientific projects
> - But Levin, in particular, has this philosophical framework that runs parallel to his empirical research
> - ? What are their philosophical positions?

## Baluska and Levin’s Definition of Cognition

> [!def]+ Cognition
> - The total set of mechanisms and processes that underlie information acquisition, store, processing, and use, at any level of organization

- On this definition of cognition:
    - & Any biological system that processes information is a cognitive system
        - i.e., the criteria for being cognitive is really basic
        - All you need to do is be some kind of information processor
- Baluska and Levin explicitly emphasize they want to talk about information processing systems at any level
    - → They believe that there is a meaningful way to say:
        - & Cytoskeleton of a single cell is an information processor
        - & Because it is an information processor, it is a cognitive system
    - Also:
        - Human heart processes information
            - Deals with signals, integrates and deals with bioelectrical signals
            - → Is a cognitive system
    - All of your individual organs are cognitive agents
    - All of those individual cells are also cognitive agents
    - A lot of the stuff that happens inside of those cells, if arranged in a system form, are also cognitive agents

## Neurons didn’t Invent Cognition — They Optimized it

- Baluska and Levin give us a way to think about cognition in systems without a brain, or any neurons, or even a central nervous system
    - Offer a slogan

> [!quote]+ Neurons didn’t invent cognition — they optimized it
> - One of the key ideas in this paper
> - Also one of the most *technical* ideas

- ; … \[Central Nervous System] neurons do not embody cognition due to any magical, unique property.
    - Neurons do not ‘produce’ cognition simply *because* they are neurons, or because they are part of a brain/CNS
    - According to Baluska and Levin:
        - Cognition does not require a brain at all
            - Probably find this claim very strange
        - They are using a functional definition of cognition
        - Cognition refers to a set of mechanisms or processes that do a certain thing, or produce a certain result
- ; \[The computational powers of neurons] derive from the dynamics of networks of linked elements that propagate and integrate signals, and their ability to alter connectivity among those elements (network topology) based on prior activity \[…]
    - Baluska and Levin are pointing out (in a very technical away) what they think allows a group of neurons to produce cognition
    - Brain or CNS or single neuron has cognitive capacities because it is a system that can transmit and integrate signals and update its configuration based on prior activity
        - Really boiling down the ability to cognize to information processing
        - Information processing is about transmitting and integrating signals and updating based on past signal activity
    - If we understand cognition in such a simple way:
        - Cognition is kind of present everywhere at least in the biological realm
    - This is what they mean when they say…
- ; “These basic properties are present in biological systems at many complexity scales. \[…] Indeed, neurons did not invent their special tricks — they merely optimized them for speed to drive adaptive behaviour” (p. 2)
    - This kind of signal-integrating and configuration-updating capacity is present throughout biological systems
    - While neurons might be the ‘best’ at cognition, they did not ‘invent’ it
        - The brain can do this the fastest, or process information more abstractly
        - But there are a lot more simpler systems in the human and animal body that can do the same kind of thing

## Bioelectricity

> [!idea] A brain/central nervous system has cognitive capacities because ==it is a system that can transmit and integrate signals and update its configuration based on prior activity==.

- Authors argue that brain has cognitive capacities
    - Because it is a system that deals with *signals* in a special kind of way
    - Levin has been studying signal-integration and processing in biological systems for a really long time
- **Developmental bioelectricity**
    - Refers to how electrical signals regulate the development of cells and tissue
    - This way of thinking of the connection between electricity and biology have come probably very naturally to Levin
        - As a developmental biologist
- Bioelectricity is also a major topic in neuroscience
    - Neurons communicate each other using action potentials
    - Rapid changes in electric voltages
    - Action potentials in developmental bioelectricity is kind of present everywhere in the biological world
        - Can find biological states in bacteria, plants, in a single cell
        - No biologist would argue against Levin about this
- & The fact that living systems harness electricity in this specific kind of way has led Levin to understand bioelectricity as a ==unifying principle in biology==
    - Wants bioelectricity to explain a lot of open questions in biology

### Two Claims

#### (1) Theoretical Claim about the Nature of Biological Cognition

- Bioelectricity somehow explains cognition in living systems
- Cognition in *living* systems can be ‘boiled down’ to bioelectricity
- **Cognition is information-processing**
    - Information-processing in living systems occurs via bioelectric signals
    - & Studying bioelectricity should tell us something insightful about cognition

#### (2) Disciplinary Hypothesis: A Better Understanding of Bioelectricity Will Dissolve Disciplinary Distinctions between Brain Sciences and Biology

- ; “Thus, firm (and disciplinary) distinctions between the science of the brain and those of the body are largely artificial hold-overs from past limitations of technology and evolutionary understanding…”
    - (“Bioelectric Networks”, p. 1883)
- Implication:
    - As we learn more about bioelectricity, these artificial hold-overs/distinctions will begin to dissolve
        - e.g., between brain sciences and (developmental) biology

## Information-processing and Cognition

- & Baluska and Levin suggest that information-processing is *sufficient* for cognition
    - Cognition, in some kind of strange way, is mainly a manifestation of bioelectricity
- In order to be a cognitive system:
    - & All a system needs to do is process information
    - Information-processing is ‘enough’, or sufficient for, cognition

> [!question] Is this true?

- Seems like a strangely broad definition of cognition
    - Thermostats or simple living devices that track conditions in the external world qualify as a cognitive system
- Many philosophers would disagree on this position
    - Depending on who you ask, the answer would be no

### Fred Adams, “Information and Cognition” (2016); “Cognition Wars” (2018)

- American philosopher of mind
- Most well-known for criticizing a position called the **Extended Mind Hypothesis**
    - This is out-of-scope for the paper

> [!quote]+ “…the mere fact that a metabolic process or type of behaviour is information-driven is not sufficient for it to be cognitive”
> (2018, p. 27)
>
> - Seems to disagree with Baluska and Levin!

- Adams has something much more belief-driven, knowledge-oriented image of cognition
    - For him:
        - Cognition is about ==mental states==
    - Thinks that information matters for cognition
        - Necessary, but is not sufficient for cognition
- % Adams is not in direct debate with Baluska and Levin
    - But what he has to say in these two papers are a good foil for what Baluska and Levin have to say

#### Adam’s Main Argument

- If information-processing were sufficient enough for cognition:
    - Then we would have to admit that simple information-processing devices like thermometers or thermostats are some kind of cognitive system
    - Simply by virtue of being conduits of information

> [!quote]+ “If being a conduit of information were sufficient for cognition, then the whole universe would think. Despite a few proponents of this view, it seems highly implausible to most”
> (2016, p. 323)

> [!quote]+ “Consider a mercury thermometer. When used to take a child’s temperature, it contains information about the body temperature of the child. The level of mercury rises or falls in perfect variation with the rise or fall in body temperature of the child. But the thermometer does not have any cognitive states, despite being a perfect carrier of information about the child’s temperature.”
> (2016, p. 324)

- **Information**
    - Adams believes:
        - Knowledge is caused by information
        - But knowledge also requires a certain about of belief and requires the correct mental states
        - Information is something you can pick up from the world
            - Some kind of signal that the world is a certain way
    - Levin and Baluska:
        - More about the reduction of uncertainty
        - Relying on a much more physics-driven approach
- Adams does not disagree that information is important
    - But if all that we needed to be cognitive was information, then tons of stuff that are informative (i.e., inform us about other states) would be a cognitive system
    - This seems highly implausible
        - Does not seem like Levin is too concerned about this debate
        - Would probably say:
            - “I do not mind that my framework has this sort of entailment”

## Why Do Levin and Baluska Define Cognition like This?

> [!quote]+ How hacking our biology could revolutionize healthcare
> “If we were able to communicate to a set of cells exactly what we want them to build, we would have the solution for birth defects, lost organs of various kinds and limbs, we could reprogram tumours back to normal. All of this could we solved if we could communicate with the collective intelligence of cells.”

- Focus on manipulation and control of biological systems
- ‘Communication’ via bioelectric signals
- @ Biomedical advances

### How Might Levin (and Baluska) Respond to the charge that Their Definition of Cognition is Too Broad?

- ? What is the purpose of defining cognition as such?
    - Levin wants to encourage cross-pollination of different research tools
    - Talks about behaviour of the embryo growing into an organism
    - Thinks that tools from neuroscience and cognitive science can productively be drawn into this developmental biology context
        - Give us something meaningful to say
        - Open avenues for research
- ? Experimentally, what makes Levin think this is plausible?
    - Had a pretty remarkable experimental successes changing the way that simple groups of cells (and much simpler organisms than humans) behave in the kind of developmental-biology context
    - From his lab:
        - **Xenobots**
            - Living robots made from frog skin cells
        - Had pseudo-organisms created by removing cells from a frog embryo at a certain point in the developmental process
        - Cells were manipulated to create a cell that behaves in a certain way
            - Behaves predictably, in a way that can be controlled
- & Levin and Baluska would not be too worried about our philosophical concerns
    - About the definition being too broad
- & Their philosophical framework is not trying to clarify the ‘true’ nature of life and cognition
    - ; “Our goal … is not to \[define cognition], but to present tools that can help with research”
        - (Manicka & Levin, 2019)
        - Similar to what Machery (2012) argues about ‘defining life’ in the lecture about [[Animacy and Inanimacy#^fee128|Animacy and Inanimacy]]
- & This definition is a research tool or ‘useful fiction’
    - Part of the toolkit that Levin is creating involves this working definition of cognition
    - He and his colleagues use this definition as a research tool
    - Definition informs his empirical work

## “On Having no head”, Baluska & Levin, 2016

> [!quote]+ “\[We favour] an intentional stance-like pragmatic, engineering approach grounded in cybernetics”
> (2016, p. 12)

- & This sentence is key to understanding *why* Baluska and levin think about cognition and life in this way

> [!goal]+ For the remainder of the lecture, we work through these three points in turn
> - Intentional stance?
> - Pragmatic approach?
> - Grounded in cybernetics?

- Hopefully, this understanding will help justify this kind of thesis

### Cybernetics

- Norbert Wiener:
    - One of the founders of the scientific study
    - Defined **cybernetics** as:
        - “the science of control and communication, in animals and machines”
            - (1948)
- Ross Ashby (1956):
    - **Cybernetics** is a theory of ‘all possible machines’
    - The field studies “all forms of behaviour in so far as they are regular, determinate, or reproducible”
        - (p. 1)
- & Cybernetics is about control
    - Does not really care about whether it is looking at organisms or machines

### Levin: an Approach ‘Grounded in Cybernetics’

- ? What might make Baluska and Levin’s approach grounded in cybernetics?
    - & Focus on manipulation/control of the system in question
        - Baluska and Levin want to think about developmental biology as a kind of behaviour space
        - Behaviour of the developing organism can be manipulated towards a direction
    - Recall video: Levin talks about communicating with cells to control growth
    - Also broader similarities in objects of study
        - Levin’s lab website is super multidisciplinary
        - Not really focusing on one specific type of biology
            - e.g., Cognitive science, AI
        - Can think of Levin as trying to look at behaviour
            - Wants to study behaviour wherever it is found
        - Thinks of behaviour as: “All forms of regular, determine, or reproducible behaviour”
        - Has a very broad understanding of behaviour
- Thinking about ‘unconventional’ biological systems as information-processors, and thus cognitive agents, is theoretical perspective that can help scientists *predict*, *control*, and *manipulate* the system they study
    - Levin and Baluska are interested in predictive and controlled powers of the theories they are applying

## Daniel Dennett’s Intentional Stance

- Daniel Dennett
    - Philosopher of mind
    - At Tufts when Levin was in his undergrad
    - Dennett and Levin have written at least one public philosophy article about cognition
- & Baluska and Levin describe their approach as **intentional stance**-like
- **Intentional stance**
    - An attitude that Dennett argues we adopt towards certain systems
    - Predicts behaviour based on the assumption that an object/system has *beliefs* and *desires*
    - This position/attitude helps predict what the system in question is going to do
    - & Dennett emphasizes that the intentional stance is required to do a good job of predicting behaviour of humans, many animals, and some robots
        - e.g., chess computers, autonomous robots that move around in the world
        - Need to assume that members of this group of systems have beliefs and desires to do a good job of predicting behaviour
        - If we are good at predicting the behaviour of a system when we adopt this stance, then this means that the system does have certain beliefs and desires in some way
    - This stance is about *predictive power*
- If we see increased predictive power when we adopt the intentional stance that assumes beliefs and desires, then this tells us something important about the nature of the system
    - System does actually have these beliefs or desires
    - Or at least justified in saying that it does
- Other stances include:
    - **Physical stance**
        - Predicts behaviour based on assumption that the object is under control of *physical* laws
    - **Design stance**
        - Predicts behaviour based on assumption that the object has been designed for a specific purpose

## Baluska and Levin’s ‘Cognitive Stance’

- Dennett is talking about mental states
    - Baluska and Levin are not interested in mental states
- Instead, Baluska and Levin are simply talking about *cognition*
    - Why they likely use the phrase “intentional stance-like”
- Can think of Baluska and Levin adopting some kind of cognitive stance
    - Though neither of them have used this term
- **Cognitive stance**
    - Would be inspired by Dennett’s intentional stance
    - A perspective that seeks to predict the behaviour of the system by assuming that a system is a *cognitive agent*
    - If this gives us more *predictive power*, we are justified to call that system cognitive
- & Adopting a kind of cognitive stance — inspired by Dennett — is about predictive power
    - Sheds some light on what Baluska and Levin are preoccupied with
    - If it was not scientifically beneficial to make these assumptions about cognition in these unconventional systems, then Baluska and Levin likely just would not do so
- Key criterion/factor that Baluska and Levin are looking at is:
    - How these theoretical assumptions affect the science that they are doing

## Pragmatism

- William James
    - American philosopher and psychologist
    - 1842-1910
- **Pragmatism**
    - As a school of philosophy in William James’ understanding:
        - ; “the attitude of looking away from first things, principles, ‘categories,’ supposed necessities; and of looking towards last things, fruits, consequences, facts”
        - (James, Lecture II, Pragmatism (1907))
- For pragmatists:
    - Philosophical inquiries should help us act in the world
    - Should be about the facts and consequences of daily affairs that we all deal with
    - General idea:
        - & Some kind of plea for philosophy to involve less metaphysics, more action

### Baluska and Levin’s Pragmatism

- $ Baluska and Levin are not interested in metaphysical speculation
    - About abstract concepts, such as being, time, knowledge, existence, etc
    - Even though Levin is working so directly with living things, there is a sense of which he is not really that interested in the nature of life as a concept or idea that we can philosophically reflect upon
- & Baluska and Levin prioritize a theoretical framework that
    - (1) Reflects contemporary scientific work
    - (2) Can actually ==help scientists conduct this work==
- Most, if not all, contemporary philosophy of science conforms to (1)
- Not every philosopher of science is interested in developing a philosophical framework that scientists then take and use
- See this real focus on scientific applicability/actionable-ness in Baluska and Levin

> [!important]+ Their thesis that ==cognition is information-processing==, and information-processing can be cached out in terms of ==bioelectricity==, is intended to help stimulate scientific research
> - Intended to make a difference in Levin’s lab
> - *Action-oriented* in the way that the original pragmatists understood their philosophy

## Summary

- **Grounded in cybernetics**
    - Focus on *manipulation* and *control* of systems in experimental research
    - Explained what cybernetics broadly is, and what it means for Levin and Baluska’s projects to be grounded in cybernetics
- **Intentional stance-like (‘Cognitive Stance’)**
    - Predicts the behaviour of systems as if they are *cognitive agents*, with the expectation that this improves *predictive power*
    - Levin does not seem to care about this distinction between machine and organism
- **Pragmatic**
    - Focused on the empirical consequences of adopting a particular theoretical perspective
    - Pragamatism is about *action*, and not abstract categories
    - Talked about what might be pragmatic about Baluska and Levin’s philosophical outlook

## Conclusions

- Baluska and Levin (2016) employ a very broad definition of cognition
    - On their view, any system that processes information is a cognitive system
- Arguably, there is reason to claim that this is not a satisfactory definition of cognition
    - (Adam’s critique)
- This type philosophical critique likely would not bother Baluska and Levin
    - Both (but particularly Levin) are focused on biomedical research outcomes
    - Levin’s ‘cognitive stance’ as a theoretical tool that (he argues) can *help advance* biomedicine
