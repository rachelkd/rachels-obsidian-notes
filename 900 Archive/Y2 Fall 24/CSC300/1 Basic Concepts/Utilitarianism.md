> [!def]- Utilitarianism
> - Ethical theory that states that the most moral action is one that *maximizes happiness and well-being* for the affected individuals

- Most popular consequentialist theory
- Developed by ==Jeremy Bentham== and ==John Stuart Mill== in the 18th century
- Actions should not be considered good or bad in and of themselves
    - only in *reference* to their **utility** i.e., usefulness in achieving happiness

> [!question]+ Is not taking action always ethical?
> - No action, no sin?
>     - e.g., Trolley problem

# Bentham’s “hedonic calculus”

- **Hedonism**:
    - Pursuit of pleasure
- Calculus:
    - Measured system (for math and also *reasoning*)
- Applying hedonic calculus to determine if an action is ethical:
    - Add up the pleasure of all involved
    - Subtract the pains for each alternative actions
    - Pick the one that promotes the most pleasure

# The Ethical Principle of Utility

- Under utilitarianism, an action is ethical if:
    - it ==brings about more happiness== for everyone affected than any identifiable alternative
- What is happiness?
    - pleasure
    - absence of pain
- Ethical action can be determined by calculating impact on human pleasure and pain
- Actions can be formalized into obligations and prohibitions
    - similar to Kant’s *duties*
- Examples of applied utilitarian ethics:
    - **obligation** to help someone who has slipped and fallen
    - **prohibition** to kill an innocent person

# Act Utilitarianism

> [!def]- Act Utilitarianism
> - Action is right if and only if it produces the greated balance of pleasure over pain for the greatest number
> - Jeremy Bentham

- Look at the consequences of act
- Calculate “utility” not just for the act happening once, but with consideration to the fact that the act may be performed many times
- Is act utilitarianism practical?
    - Yes:
        - Can follow rules-of-thumb (accumulated wisdome based on consequences in the past)
        - Engage in individual calculation only when there is some pressing reason for doing so
    - No:
        - No time to calculate at each point in time what the pleasure/pain consequence will be

# Rule Utilitarianism

> [!warning]+ Objection to act utilitarianism: Pleasures differ in quality as well as quantity
> - John Stuart Mill
>
> > “It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied; And if the fool or the pig think otherwise, that is because they know only their own side of the qeustion. The other party to the comparison knows both sides.”

> (*Utilitarianism*, 1861)

- We should not look at individual acts

- Instead of applying hedonic calculus on individual acts, why don’t we take that action and see if that action was a ==universal rule, would that make more universal pleasure than pain==?
    - Yes → Action is ethical
    - No → Action is not ethical

> [!def]- Rule utilitarianism
> - Action is right if and only if it conforms to a *set of rules* the general acceptance of which would produce the greatest balance of pleasure over pain for the greatest number
> - John Stuart Mill

- Following rules that maximize overall benefit, so you don’t need to decide what to do in every situation
    - e.g., never commit adultery (harm to marriage outweighs benefits)
    - Donate 5% of income to charity (benefit to society outweighs cost to you)
    - Never eat meat (benefit to other living beings outweighs cost to you)
