# Connections between Computers and Ethics

- Networks (esp. social networks)
    - Software industry may introduce profound changes in how people interact
- Discuss the binary ethical concepts of rational
    - Enabled *good* things and *bad* things
- A host of petty crimes
    - e.g., phishing, hacking
- Heinous crimes
    - e.g., stalking children in chat rooms
- “Clever” ideas
    - e.g., Facebook news feed manipulation: want to make money in industry → make features → impact national elections

Now that “innovation has been pushed to the edges,” you may have to make some hard choices.

# Morals vs. Ethics

- What is a **moral**?
    - An instance of a *system of ethics*
        - Principles or habits with respect to right or wrong conduct
    - Morality ultimately is a ==personal compass== of right and wrong
        - Morals can also prescribe do’s and don’ts
    - Where does your personal morality come from?
        - e.g., Culture
        - Different things have come together impact decisions you make; what you should and shouldn’t do → created a morality inside you
- What is **ethics**?
    - Philosophical, social system from which the ==morals of a society== arise
    - The rules of conduct recognized in respect to a particular class of human actions or a particular group or culture
    - Holding society at a ==larger scale==, so that society doesn’t do something wrong
        - e.g., Religion, national system
- There is a significant difference between morality and ethics
    - e.g., Religion is an *ethical system* that tells you what to do on a larger scale.
    - You, as a person, might belong to a particular group, but also a family; coming from a plethora of culture, all these ethical systems come together → ==you make your own moral compass== of how you decide based on multiple factors
- Possible for a person’s own morality to become an ethical system
    - e.g., Karl Marx’s communism: people subscribed to his morality because they believed it was the right thing to do → challenged economic structures
    - ==What we implement on computers goes to everyone → think about morality and ethics==
- Possible for person’s morality to go against ethical rules

# Computers and Ethics

- Censoring search engine results
    - Good:
        - Protects children from bad things
    - Bad:
        - Impinges on freedom of information

> [!important] A society must find its own way to *balance* rights
>
> - e.g., freedoms of expression, association etc.
> - Damaging side effects: incitement to riot, etc.

- Different groups of people will arrive at different compromises

# Ethics and Ethical Reasoning: Core Issues and Questions

- Richard William Paul, Linda Elder define ethics as:
    - “a set of concepts and principles that guide us in determining what behaviour helps or harms sentient creatures”

## Moral Ontology: What Are the Ways People Make Their Arguments?

1. **Virtue ethics**
    1. What and who should I be?
    2. More about being a moral and ethical person who is good
    3. More about individual character building, excellence, productivity, meaning of life
    4. These kinds of questions interested the early Greek philosophers
2. **Deontology**
    1. What should I do? What rules should I follow?
    2. What is my duty, obligation, (also, disallowance, and outlawing)
3. **Utilitarianism**
    1. What should I do? What rules should I follow?
    2. Looks at particular instances in a different light
    3. Right and wrong

# Virtue Ethics: Plato, Aristotle, and the Greeks

See [[Virtue Ethics]].

# Deontological Ethics: Immanuel Kant

- [[Deontological Ethics]]

# Consequentialism

- [[Utilitarianism]]

# Which Moral Values Deserve to Be Moral Rights?

- Societies are diverse:
    - Moral than one ethical framework is usually at play in any society
        - e.g., religious beliefs of different communities, regulations, ethics committees in human-oriented research and hospitals
    - We live in a highly connected world → people make different moral judgements
        - e.g., Influence of “Divine Inspiration,” or utilitarianism
    - Some religious societies may base morals on holy writings more than other secular societies
        - Most are a compromise

> [!question] How do we negotiate differences in our ethics?
>
> - Shift away from a universal ethical framework

## Rationality vs. Relationality

- **Rationality**:
    - Dominant view in Western though and epistemology (see [[Introduction to Ethics]])
        - assuming a universal standpoint
    - Privileges ==reason and logical== coherence for knowledge and decision-making
    - Seeks certainty, stability, and order through isolation, separation, and clear binaries
    - Objective
- **Relationality**:
    - Emphasizes ==subjective== standpoints and the primacy of ==relationships==
    - Privileges context, relationships between people, and lived experiences
    - Includes approaches like Feminist Care Ethics, Afro-feminist epistemologies, and ubuntu (sub-Saharan African philosophy)

## Relational Epistemologies

- **Feminist Care Ethics**:
    - Recognizes that relationships of care cannot be captured by traditional European ethical theories
        - e.g., parents caring for young children
- **Afro-feminist epistemology**:
    - Asserts that people are not passive observers but gain knowledge and understanding through ==concrete lived experiences==, not abstract contemplation

## Ethics Based on Relationality

- Rethinking of justice and ethics as a ==set of broad, contingent, and fluid concepts== that need to be grounded in ==lived experiences, relationships, and context==
    - e.g., *Knowing* that ==centers human relations==
    - Bias is not a deviation from the “correct” description
        - e.g., treating a mom differently is not practicing a bias, equity and quality vs. equal right
    - Prioritizing of *understanding* over prediction
    - Centring the *disproportionately impacted*
    - Computer science as a practice that *alters* the social fabric
