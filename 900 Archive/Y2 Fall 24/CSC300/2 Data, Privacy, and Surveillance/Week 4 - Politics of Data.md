# Why is Data Collected?

- **Data for a purpose**:
    - Data was collected by someone using some *methods*, *tools* with intention
    - Whenever there is data, there is intention behind it
- Data can be a way to ==articulate and interpret the structure of systems==
    - Data is collected to satisfy the needs of people
- Foundational to the creation of ==tools== and ==technologies== to understand the world around us
    - e.g., Tools that support policy-making, information-processing, etc.
        - FitBit: Created to collect and show data about activity patterns

> [!question]+ Questions to consider when you use data:
>
> - Who collected this data, and why?
> - What was their intention for collecting this data?

### Ex. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) Infrastructure

- Developed to collect data worldwide on diseases in order to:
    - ==Protect citizens==
        - But also led to development of *nation state*
            - Start by focusing on your own country → thinking you are a nation → anyone coming from outside = dangerous, carries diseases
    - ==Control for the spread of misinformation==
        - But also became the grounds for surveillance
    - ==Provide a global architecture for states to understand local and global diseases==
        - But also exposed global-local intensions of disease classification and protocol

# Why is Data Political?

- Misconceptions about politics:
    - Political ≠ bad
    - Politics ≠ national politics
- Data can be a tool to understand the world
    - Researchers want to prove a point: way they collect data will prove this point they have beforehand
- **Categorization** of data into categories is *not* neutral
    - Important for collecting data
    - Created by humans
- **Data collection, organization, and use** are based on historical and political judgements
    - e.g., Year, election date, election type, party, district, etc.
    - One side might bring up data; other side might bring up another dataset
    - Human researchers have different biases in their mind
        - Reflected on how they plan about data collection
        - Biases are already embedded in the policy of collecting data
        - Person who *collects* further adds biases
        - Becomes a political statement about what they believe in

# Data Categorization

## Who is Included?

- Who is *included*, and who is left out?
    - e.g., Refugees might be considered non-citizens in censuses, but still rely on services in the country they are in
    - Permanent residents are not citizens ⇒ not allowed to vote for the candidate according to their needs
    - If you do not give a voice to those unrepresented in the voting system, how do you expect the outcome of the voting being supportive of this population?
- Which *categories* are created, and which are left out?
    - e.g., AIDS historically not recognized as a disease by the ICD
- Whose interests guide category formation?
    - Different stakeholders have different uses

## How is Data Categorized?

- Need to ask ourselves:
    - ==Who== collects the data, and ==about whom== it is collected
        - e.g., Automated app, developer(s) of the app
        - Need to look into them and find their politics
    - ==Validity== of the informant/data collector
    - Whose ==narrative is prioritized==: agenda-setting
        - Person who has the most power → run larger scale surveys → voice will be reflected more
        - Implicitly “otherizes”
        - e.g., Censuses not recognizing non-citizens (refugees, illegal immigrants, etc.) as members of the community

## Which Categories Are Created?

- The **recognition of categories** can be a slow, politicized process
    - e.g., AIDS achieved status as a disease through active, persistent efforts of gay and sexual political activism
- Some categories are ==deliberately misrepresented/misused== based on cultural contexts
    - e.g., Different statistics of heart attack in the US and Japan

## Whose Interests Are Represented?

- Different stakeholders require the information for different reasons
    - ⇒ Will want categories according

### Case Study: War on Drugs

- **State/government**
    - e.g., Policies/laws created surrounding drug use
    - Sending people to jail; mostly racially marginalized people
- **Organizations in the genre of data set**
    - e.g., Drug policy alliance
    - What counts as a drug
- **Industry**
    - e.g., Pharmaceutical companies
        - Shorter list, definition of addictive drugs ⇒ make more money selling “normal medicine”
        - Were not happy with a broad definition of drugs
            - Could not make business selling medicine e.g., sleeping pills
    - e.g., Prison Industrial Complex
        - Put more people in prisons ⇒ make more money
- **Individuals** practicing in fields relevant to the data set
    - e.g., Doctors, psychiatrists, pharmacists, paramedics, etc.

> [!important] Data is political because the categorization is an output of politics.

# Infrastructure of Data Processing

- Once you have classification and categorization, and build a tool for collecting data, you still need infrastructure, or a system, to get data regularly collected
    - i.e., get data stored, analyzed, used
- Components of the infrastructure introduce additional biases to data

## Properties of Infrastructure

- What is **infrastructure**?
    - Underlying foundation or basic framework (of a system or organization)
    - Makes work easier, faster, more coordinated
        - Supports systems while being linked to existing conventions
    - Supports knowledge and industry
    - Creating an infrastructure is a ==social, political, and theoretical enterprise==
    - e.g., Zoom requires an Internet infrastructure
        - Meetings would not be possible without it
        - If infrastructure has some biases, then it would affect quality of the class
        - Also relies on electricity infrastructure → fossil fuel sources, for example → and so on

- Properties of infrastructure:
    - is **embedded**
    - is **transparent**
    - has spatio-temporal reach
    - learned as part of membership
        - e.g., Need to be UofT student to get UofT infrastructure
    - links ==convention with practice==
    - embodies **standards**
    - built on an installed base
    - visible upon breakdown
        - e.g., You don’t care about power, Internet until it breaks down
    - fixed in increments; not all at once

## Figure-ground Problem

- **Figure-ground problem**:
    - Systems or infrastructure (ground) underlying data sets, practices, tools, technologies (figures) ==created to address certain aspects of society== are ==contingent with history and their political origins==
    - Requires **infrastructural inversion**
        - Understand how infrastructure actually works

## Multiple Infrastructures Exist to Support Most Data Sets

- ==Multiple infrastructures will coexist== and interact to modulate data processing
    - e.g., What you do on your computer is dependent on history
- Data does not exist in a vacuum
    - Aspects of infrastructure should be examined

### Ex. Scientific Research Project

- Infrastructures involved:
    - Computer technology
        - Software and hardware used by people
    - Community of science; social:
        - Power imbalances between established researchers, those breaking into the field, hired research assistants/undergraduates
    - Community of science; technical
        - Standards of methods, language, journal submission, conference organization
    - Community that supports:
        - Janitors cleaning facilities where data is collected
        - Secretaries coordinating integration and meetings amongst scientists

# Data and the State

- Data collection often determines:
    - the **outcome of policy** in all aspects of life
        - e.g., Public health, economics, social, etc.
    - e.g., Determining the allocation of resources/funding
    - e.g., Ontario cuts to autism funding seemed to forget most stakeholders
- Large-scale data collection efforts are often state-enforced
    - Create tools for ==communication== and ==control==
        - Communication over time/space
        - Control across communities

# Design of Data Technologies

- Often contingent on configuration of existing computing/technological developments
    - e.g., Amount of data collected will necessarily be limited by how much storage space is available
- Need to ensure **backward/sideways compatibility** with existing infrastructures
- All these infrastructural and technological pieces coming into play to collect/store data have different biases → reflect on data set

### Ex. Captchas

- Google fails to identify if someone is human
- Asks users questions about places that they may not belong to
    - Result of a limitation of technology that they are using for data collection
    - Does not include non-NA-centric images

# Data and an Advanced Computing Landscape

- **Data as a resource**
    - Large-scale data collection is expensive and resource-intensive
    - ==Need to have power and money== to do so
- **Who has the power and money**
    - Large tech companies
        - e.g., Amazon, Facebook, etc.
    - Governments
    - Universities
        - More money → more power
- As a data scientist, you analyze the data
    - You do not see what data is *not* there
    - Difference between traditional and critical data scientist:
        - Trad.: Only analyze data given to them
        - Critical: Questions who is collecting, where, why, what tools were used, what infrastructure is involved? ⇒ Understand importance of data, how the data is interpreted

## Ex. Google Sidewalk Labs

- Idea:
    - Wanted to make Toronto a smart city
    - Install sensors to track how many people come to which place, when, what they’ll do
    - Would automate society based on data:
        - When lights would be on/off
- Torontonians refused to be under surveillance
- Google failed:
    - Constantly collecting data from people → people did not want privacy to be compromised
- When collecting data, you need to understand **human factors** i.e. ,what people want

# Critical Data Analysis: What Do We Do Now?

- Understand that your data is not complete
    - Excluding a lot of people’s voices
    - Data is imperfect and incomplete
    - Humans involved have different biases
    - Technical pieces/infrastructure have different limitations
- What is *not* there in the data set?
    - Consideration of this question ⇒ Understand what you are seeing
- Maintain **heterogeneity**
    - Data can be interpreted in different ways
    - Unitary knowledge categories won’t work
- Maintain parallel or multiple representations of data
    - Complementary localization
- Pay attention to **existing infrastructures**
    - Different infrastructures at different levels of reference
- Recognize that narratives are:
    - **Heteropraxial**
        - When there are different practices according to region, local constraints, and beliefs
    - **Heteroglossial**
        - When there are multiple voices rather than one monotonous voice
- Understand the influence of ==power==
    - Institutional, structural, and/or financial

### Ex. What Does the Data Collected by These Two Institutions Tell Us?

College X reports 22 cases of sexual harassment.
College Y reports 59 cases of sexual harassment.

- May seem that sexual harassment is more prevalent in College Y than in College X
- However, College Y fosters a more supportive environment for students to report abuse
    - College X may have an environment that discourages reporting
    - → Students feel uncomfortable approaching peers or teachers about such issues
- If you think data is just numbers, you are missing the most important aspect of the data: ==context==
- What infrastructures underlie the data?
    - University policy and consequences
    - Local justice system and consequences
    - How can someone report it? In person, anonymously, online, etc.?
    - Cultural representation of sexual harassment
        - What constitutes a case of harassment
        - How are those that report it treated by peers

# Summary

- Data:
    - is **collected** for a **purpose**
    - is **organized** according to certain prioritized groups and genres
    - is **processed** according to existing **infrastructures**
    - can be used as a tool of control by the state
- To mitigate biases and prevent their perpetuation:
    - One must practice **critical data analysis** to better *understand* the source, use, and development of data processing

# Tutorial

## Data Can Be Misleading

- Hiding relevant data
- Presenting too much data
- Distorting the presentation of data
- Describing the data inaccurately in annotations, title, or within the data visualization itself
