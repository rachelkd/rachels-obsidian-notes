# Probability Distribution

> [!def]- Probability distribution
> - The **probability distribution** of a [[Random Variables|RV]] $X$ (based on a random experiment and associated sample space) tells us:
>     - What values $X$ can take on and how to assign probabilities to those values

> [!def]- Probability mass function (pmf)
> - For a discrete random variable $X$ that takes values in a set $S$, the **pmf** is the probability function:
>     - $p(x) = P(X = x), \text{for }x \in S$
>     - Implicitly, 0, otherwise

- Pmfs are the central objects in discrete probability → allow one to compute probabilities
- Know the pmf of a random variable $\implies$ have “complete knowledge” of the behaviour of that random variable
