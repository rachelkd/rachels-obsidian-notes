> [!goal]- Learning Objectives
>
> 1. Use set notation and Venn diagrams to describe events in a given sample space
> 2. Explain probability models and basic probability and set theory vocabulary
> 3. Solve problems applying event operations, properties of probability, and in the case of equally-likely outcomes, counting methods
> 4. Use R to simulate basic experiments and estimate the probability of an outcome
>     - e.g., coin flipping, rolling rice

# Review

From [[Week 1 - Course Introduction, Outcomes, Events, and Probabilities]]:

- Suppose you flip a coin 3 times. What is the sample space?
    - $\Omega = \{ HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, TTH, TTT \}$
    - 8 outcomes
- You are interested in the event that you get 3 heads. How would you write this? How many outcomes does this event contain?
    - $A = \{ \text{get the heads} \} = \{HHH\}$
- You are interested in the event you get at most 1 heads. How would you write this? How many outcomes does this event contain?
    - $B = \{ \text{get at most 1 heads}\} = \{ HTT, THT, TTH, TTT\}$
    - 4 outcomes
