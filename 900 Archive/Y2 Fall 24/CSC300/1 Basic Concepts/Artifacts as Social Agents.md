# Artifacts as Social Agents

See [[Week 3 - The Politics of Technology]].

## Introduction: The Agency of Artifacts

Do artifacts act? Should agency be assigned to them in accounts of social change? Or are human beings and social structures like groups and organizations the only social agents? This is a pivotal question for technology studies, but one that has not received an unequivocal answer so far.

On the one hand, the literature in technology studies is filled with examples and cases that suggest that technological artifacts and systems do act: they have been claimed to prescribe behaviours, constrain political arrangements, induce cultural beliefs and practices, and shape aspects of their social context. On the other hand, the social constructivist orientation of a large part of technology studies seems to be incompatible with an attribution of agency to artifacts, because it maintains that alleged properties of artifacts can be reduced to the actions and interpretations of social groups.

### Technological Change and Social Context

There is general agreement in technology studies that the introduction and use of a new technology is often accompanied by significant changes in its social context. Such changes may include changes in individual and collective behaviours, attitudes and beliefs, in social statuses and roles, and in social structures and institutions. This generally accepted idea goes against the notion that technologies are neutral, in the sense that they are mere means-to-ends that function to perform certain tasks more quickly, efficiently or powerfully, and that a proper analysis of them focuses on their function as a means to chosen ends.

It is a core belief of technology studies that technologies must also be understood, and perhaps centrally, as building blocks of society and as instigators of social change, in ways that are often unrelated to their intended functions.

### Perspectives on Technological Agency

But here the agreement stops. One may agree that the widespread use of the birth-control pill has been accompanied by, and can be correlated with, sexual liberation and greater freedom for women, and that without the pill these changes might not have occurred. However, perspectives differ about the agentive role of the pill in this whole process:

1. **Realist Perspective**: The pill can be seen as a powerful actor, a hero (or villain) that single-handedly gave sexual freedom to generations of liberated women. In this epic, the pill may be depicted as a liberator, with sexual freedom written all over its chemical code.

2. **Social Constructivist Perspective**: Sexual liberation is not created by a little pill, but by people who were already in the process of a revolution. The pill becomes important through the meanings attributed to it and its involvement in real-life practices. In this view, pills do not act; they are inherently powerless and amorphous.

### Three Dominant Perspectives

The essay identifies three dominant perspectives on the nature and status of technological artifacts:

1. **Realist Perspective**: Artifacts have inherent properties, and agency can be attributed to them straightforwardly.

2. **Social Constructivist Perspective**: Artifacts do not have inherent properties, only imputed or attributed properties. Any imputed agency ultimately derives from individual and social group interpretations.

3. **Hybrid Perspective** (Actor-Network Theory): The distinction between social and technical/material should be abolished. Artifacts and their properties emerge from being embedded in a network of human and nonhuman entities.

### Conclusion

The author concludes that none of these perspectives provides a satisfactory account of the agency of artifacts and proposes an alternative perspective called “**differentiated constructivism**.”

## Realism in Technological Agency

### Realist Perspective on Technological Change

Realists maintain that social change accompanying the use of a technology can often be causally correlated with the design structure of these technologies themselves. They argue that technologies can possess powers for effecting change and can be analyzed as acting. Crucially, the agency of artifacts is seen as irreducible to the agency of human agents involved in their production, regulation, or use.

#### Examples Supporting Realist Position

Several notable examples illustrate how technological design constrains or enables practices, beliefs, or social configurations:

1. **Latour’s Examples**:
   - Hotel keys with heavy weights to encourage guests to return them to the reception desk
   - Seatbelts that prompt specific user behaviours

2. **Sclove’s Observation**:
   - Modern sofas with multiple seat cushions define personal spaces
   - Reflects and perpetuates Western culture’s emphasis on individuality and privacy
   - Contrasts with Japanese futon sofa-beds

3. **Winner’s Nuclear Power Plant Analysis**:
   - Nuclear power plants require centralized, hierarchical managerial control
   - Cannot be safely run in an egalitarian manner
   - Differs from solar energy technology’s potential organizational flexibility

### Technological Essentialism

Within a naive form of realism, technologies may have inherent powers that manifest in any context:

- Technologies can be inherently:
    - Authoritarian
    - Democratic
    - Unjust
    - Deskilling
    - Repressive
    - Egalitarian
    - Individualistic
    - Masculine
    - Western

#### Key Proponents of Technological Essentialism

- **Langdon Winner**: Argued some technologies are “inherently political”
    - Example: Atom bomb requires centralized, rigid hierarchical command
- **Ivan Illich**: Distinguished between convivial and anti-convivial tools
- **Lewis Mumford**: Distinguished between democratic and authoritarian technology
- **Feminist Technologists**: Analyzed technology as inherently masculine or patriarchal

### Contextual Realism

A more sophisticated approach recognizes the context-relativity of technological effects. Contextual realism holds that artifacts may impose constraints derived from physical design properties, but these constraints can differ across environments.

#### Case Study: Long Island Bridges

Winner’s famous example demonstrates contextual realism:
- Bridges built at low heights (less than 12 feet)
- Prevented buses from passing
- Effectively blocked public transport access to Long Island
- Disproportionately impacted Black communities dependent on public transportation

##### Analysis of Discriminatory Design

- The bridges’ height was not inherently discriminatory
- Became discriminatory in specific social and economic contexts
- Discriminatory character emerged from the “fit” between physical design and use context

### Limitations of Realist Perspectives

Realist analyses tend to:
- Emphasize physical structure and operations
- Play down the role of social factors
- Underestimate the importance of social representations

#### Social Representation’s Role

Social representations determine:
- How artifacts are perceived
- Recognized features and functions
- Evaluation of artifacts
- Actual usage
- Resulting consequences

##### Examples of Social Representation

1. **Pink Baby Clothes**:
   - Beyond clothing function
   - Perpetuate gender stereotypes
   - Symbolize femininity
   - Promote specific treatment of baby girls

2. **Victorian Hallway Bench**:
   - Marked social status through design
   - Uncomfortable seating for servants
   - Ornate mirrors and hat hooks emphasized class distinctions

### Conclusion

Realist perspectives often underestimate how social representations mediate between technology and social context. Technologies rarely force behaviour directly. Instead, social representations of technological meaning and potential are crucial in driving social change.

The concept of “interpretive flexibility” highlights that people can attribute widely different functions, abilities, and properties to the same technology.

## Social Constructivism in Technological Agency

### Core Principles

Social constructivists emphasize that technological agency is primarily determined by social representations. Unlike realists, they argue that:

- Artifacts have “interpretive flexibility”
- Different social groups can assign different interpretations to the same technology
- Social representations fully determine technological agency

#### Interpretation as Textual Reading

The process of understanding technology is often described through a textual metaphor:
- Artifacts are like texts with multiple possible readings
- Social negotiation can lead to “closure” where one dominant interpretation prevails
- Alternative readings become marginalized

### Pfaffenberger’s Theory of Political Agency

Bryan Pfaffenberger developed a sophisticated social constructivist approach focusing on political agency through:

1. **Affordances**:
   - Perceived properties suggesting how artifacts should be used
   - Not objective design features
   - Socially constructed interpretations

2. **Discursive Regulation**:
   - Dominant interpretations must be legitimated through persuasive discourse
   - Symbolic discourses (myths, rituals, classifications) are most effective
   - Example: Victorian hallway bench’s class distinction narrative

3. **Secular Ritual**:
   - Standardized practices that regulate social behavior
   - Brings political affordances to life
   - Example: Hallway space decorum defining social hierarchies

### Artifact Definition and Agency

Social constructivists debate whether artifacts themselves have agency:
- Physical objects as neutral carriers of social representation
- Or artifacts as inherently social constructions
- Reality itself potentially viewed as a social construction

### Challenging Social Constructivism

Critiques of the social constructivist approach include:

1. Potential overemphasis on social processes
2. Neglect of physical design properties
3. Overlooking material constraints that exist independent of interpretation

#### Physical Constraints

Two types of physical constraints are identified:

1. **Strong Physical Constraints**:
   - Physically require or prevent certain actions
   - Operate by physical laws
   - Example: Long Island bridges preventing bus passage

2. **Weak Physical Constraints**:
   - Promote, discourage, or hamper actions
   - Can be countered
   - Example: Hotel keys with weights encouraging return to front desk

### Constraints

#### Forcing Functions

Forcing functions are physical constraints that require users to perform specific acts not directly related to their intended artifact use.

##### Characteristics

- Intentionally designed
- Often implemented for safety purposes
- Developed by Donald Norman

##### Types of Forcing Functions

1. **Interlocks**
   - Force operations to occur in proper sequence
   - Examples:
     - Fire extinguisher safety pin
     - Rifle safety mechanism
     - Automated cash dispensers requiring card removal
     - Microwave oven power disconnection when door opens

2. **Lockins**
   - Keep an operation active
   - Prevent premature stopping
   - Example: Computer soft shutdown process

3. **Lockouts**
   - Prevent entry to dangerous areas
   - Prevent unwanted events
   - Example: Bar at basement stairs to prevent panicked exit during fire

#### Userand Use-Excluding Physical Constraints

Physical constraints that limit artifact use based on:
- User’s physical attributes
- Required physical competencies

##### Examples

- Doorways preventing entry based on body size
- Fifty-pound cement bags requiring specific physical strength
- Computers requiring visual ability or assistive technologies

#### Other Strong Physical Constraints

Constraints that affect user behavior beyond direct artifact use:
- Driving a car requires specific body positioning
- ATM transactions with strict time limits
- Windowless rooms preventing external view
- Irreparable electrical appliances
- Vehicular design preventing driver-passenger interaction
- Noise preventing conversation
- Building structures blocking visual access

#### Social Constructivist Challenges to Physical Constraints

Social constructivists argue that apparent physical constraints are actually social constructions:

##### First Argument: User Interpretation

- Users can “misread” constraints
- Potential for reinterpreting artifact limitations
- Counterargument: Some constraints remain immutable (e.g., buses under low bridges)

##### Second Argument: Analyst Interpretation

- Physical constraints are analyst’s social constructions
- Deny objective verifiability of physical properties
- Challenge the distinction between objective and socially constructed features

#### Philosophical Debate

##### Social Constructivist Position (Woolgar)

- “Self-evidence” is a social accomplishment
- Caution against accepting uncontroversial “truths”
- Encourage deeper critique of technological constraints

##### Balanced Perspective

- Acknowledge social construction in perceiving physical properties
- Recognize limits of constant deconstruction
- Allow cautious reference to physical constraints
- Avoid reducing all technological impacts to social interpretation

#### Conclusion

While social representations significantly influence technological understanding, some physical constraints remain objectively verifiable and important in analyzing technological agency.

## Hybrid Constructivism

- **Definition**: Hybrid constructivism applies the principle of generalised symmetry, assigning similar explanatory roles to all elements (social, natural, or technical) in an analysis.
    - Proponents: Callon, Latour, and others within actor-network theory.
    - Methodology: Phenomena are outcomes of heterogeneous networks of actants (both human and nonhuman) with symmetrical explanatory roles.

- **Criticism of Social Constructivism**:
    - Overemphasizes social elements, excluding natural/technical factors as explanatory.
    - Hybrid constructivists argue for equal consideration of all elements in networks.

- **Key Concepts**:
    - **Actants**: Entities (human/nonhuman) with competencies to act and influence.
    - **Networks**: Stabilized associations of actants creating phenomena (e.g., traffic lights directing traffic rely on infrastructure, road users, and electricity).
    - **Delegation/Translation**: Transfer of actions to actants for efficiency (e.g., a door closer replacing a human butler).
    - **Prescriptions**: Expectations encoded in actants (e.g., traffic lights assume road users respond from specific perspectives).
    - **Scripts**: Roles defined by artifacts and associated settings.

- **Rejection of Traditional Distinctions**:
    - Rejects separations between nature/society and physical/behavioral attributes.
    - Advocates analyzing interactions holistically.

- **Critiques of Alternative Models**:
    - **Realism**: Overlooks the influence of networks, favoring technological determinism.
    - **Social Constructivism**: Neglects nonhuman agency, rendering objects powerless.

## Differentiated Constructivism

- **Definition**: Proposes agency arises from both the material design of artifacts (realism) and social processes (social constructivism).
    - Maintains the distinction between physical/technical and social/symbolical factors.

- **Core Ideas**:
    - Some affordances/constraints are purely physical, others purely social, and some are hybrids.
    - Encourages separating these factors in analyses when possible.

- **Examples**:
    - **Victorian Bench**:
        - Physical design (hard, plain) influences perceptions tied to class.
        - Social representation (plainness = lower class) interacts with physical properties.
    - **Locked Door**:
        - Physical properties directly constrain access (requires a key).
    - **Western Sofa**:
        - Cushions physically and socially enforce individuality and privacy.
    - **Ibiza Washing Machines**:
        - Running water/washing machines enable new behaviors, leading to weakened social ties.

- **Comparison to Realism**:
    - Retains the realist focus on physical properties but emphasizes social representations.
    - Physical constraints may indirectly influence social phenomena.

- **Integration with Hybrid Constructivism**:
    - Both models can coexist in analyses, with hybrid constructivism focusing on symmetrical networks and differentiated constructivism emphasizing separable contributions.
