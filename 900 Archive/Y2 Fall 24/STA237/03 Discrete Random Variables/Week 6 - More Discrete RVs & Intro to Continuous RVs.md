> [!goal]- Learning Objectives
> 1. Distinguish between common discrete probability distributions such as the discrete uniform, Binomial, Hypergeometric, Negative Binomial, Geometric, and Poisson distributions.
> 2. Select appropriate discrete probability distributions to model random phenomena and solve related problems.
> 3. Simulate observations of discrete random variables to estimate probabilities, expected values, and variances in R.
> 4. Use built-in discrete probability R functions to compute probabilities and simulate observed values of discrete random variables.
> 5. Describe continuous probability distributions and compute probabilities using probability density functions (pdfs).
