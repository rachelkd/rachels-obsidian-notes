## Course Overview and Learning Objectives

> [!goal]+ Learning Objectives
> After this lecture students will:
>
> - Understand race as social construct
> - Learn race’s impact on CS biases
> - Comprehend social injustice in computing
> - Consider interventions for racial inequality

## Key Topics

- Learning objectives and key terms
- Current design problems
- Intersectional analysis
- Race, computing, and equity:
  - Education context
  - Workplace context
- Theoretical perspectives on race
- Examples of race-equitable designs

## Race as a Social Construct

> [!def]+ Definition
> Race refers to combinations of:
>
> - Skin color
> - Ancestry
> - Religion
> - Ethnicity
>
> It is an ambiguous category that varies by social context

> [!important]+ Key Points
>
> - Race cannot be established at molecular level
> - More genetic diversity within races than between them
> - Categories shift based on:
>   - Social/political context
>   - Historical period
>   - Geographic location
>   - Cultural factors

### Race Performance

> [!info]+ How Race is Performed
>
> - Through learned behaviors
> - Shaped by:
>   - Social pressures
>   - Traditions
>   - Media influence
>   - Cultural expectations
>   - Community norms

## Problems in Current Computing Systems

> [!warning]+ Examples of Racial Bias
>
> 1. Microsoft’s Tay AI Chatbot
>     - Learned racist behavior within 24 hours
>     - Had to be shut down
>
> 2. Image Recognition Issues
>     - Google Photos labeling Black people as gorillas
>     - HP webcams not detecting dark skin
>     - Microsoft Kinect failing with darker skin tones
>
> 3. Healthcare Algorithms
>     - Kidney function estimates biased against Black patients
>     - Different scoring systems by race
>
> 4. Voice Recognition
>     - Lower accuracy for non-white accents
>     - Bias in speech-to-text systems

## Model Minority Myth

> [!warning]+ The “Model Minority” Stereotype
>
> - Primarily affects Asian/Asian-American communities
> - Creates harmful expectations:
>   - Academic excellence assumed
>   - Technical aptitude expected
>   - Social isolation accepted
> - Real impacts:
>   - Mental health issues
>   - Leadership underrepresentation
>   - “Bamboo ceiling” effect
>   - Erasure of struggles

### Harvard Case Study Example

> [!example]+ Harvard Admissions Controversy
>
> - 2018 lawsuit revealed bias in “personality ratings”
> - Asian applicants consistently rated lower
> - Highlighted systemic discrimination
> - Exposed flaws in “meritocracy” narrative

## Representation Issues in Computing

> [!obs]+ Current Problems
>
> 1. Video Games
>     - Light skin tones as default
>     - Limited racial diversity in characters
>     - Only 3% Hispanic characters (2009 study)
>     - Native American/biracial representation non-existent
>
> 2. Emoji Design
>     - Initial “universal yellow” approach
>     - Limited hair texture/style options
>     - Restricted skin tone combinations
>     - Questions about true inclusivity
>     - Racialized emojis insert race into text and tweets where it never would have arisen before

## Race, Computing, and Equity

### Workforce

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVW5fQv.png)

- Pay inequity across racial lines
- Promotion disparities
- Leadership representation gaps
- Cultural isolation
- Limited advancement opportunities

### The Education Gap

![](https://i.imgur.com/cSYTO0H.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/gbwPP8o.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/Tb6BDsU.png)

- Big disparity between white men and other gendered and racialized groups
- Black, Latina, and Native American women are a low and declining percentage of computing degree recipients
- Unequal access to CS education
- Disparities in:
    - Enrolment rates
    - Retention rates
    - Graduation rates
    - Access to resources
    - Mentorship opportunities

### The Pay Gap

![](https://i.imgur.com/lqhSysb.png)

- Asian people are paid more than White, Black, and Latinx people overall
    - For both men and women
- Most of the Asian people get the top jobs in the company, so they get paid more
- At the same level of job hierarchy, lots of instances where Asian men make more than their female counterparts and other races

### The Opportunity Gap

Factors affecting educational and career outcomes:

- Socioeconomic status
- English proficiency
- Community wealth
- Family situations
- Social capital access
- Professional networks

## Intersectional Approaches to Race and Gender

> [!def]+ Intersectionality
> - Term coined by legal scholar Kimberle Crenshaw in 1989
>     - Introduced in a famous paper given to the Chicago Legal Forum
> - Thesis:
>     - Categories of identity (i.e., race and gender) and related forms of oppression cannot be understood or addressed separately
>     - Society and law must understand that race and gender do not impact people independently from one another
>     - Rather, they ==interact or intersect==, and most often *enforce* each other

- Using an intersectional approach to understand (in)equality and privilege on three larger levels:
    - Structural (in)equality and privilege
    - Political (in)equality and privilege
    - Representational (in)equality and privilege

### Structural (In)equality and Privilege

- When *social structures* ==shape the experiences== of individuals by favouring some components of their identity while ignore others
- Examples:
    - Economically-disadvantaged women may experience difficulty accessing counselling services and resources
        - These have been allocated according to the needs of economically privileged women
    - Counselling services for domestic abuse survivors may be in neighbourhoods that are very difficult to access by public transit, or
        - May be only held at times that serve women who work 9-5 jobs and are therefore not accessible to women who do shift work
- & Structure of services are often designed in a way that is marginalizing some people
    - Definitely some women are getting access to services, but not all women

### Political (In)equality and Privilege

- When some components of identity, and not others, are favoured in *political strategy* and *agenda*
- Examples:
    - Interests of women of colour may be marginalized in favour of what are considered to be interests of their ‘community’ as a whole
    - Political platforms that claim to be ‘racially progressive’ may ignore experiences of women in this group
        - e.g., Refusal of agencies to release domestic violence data by race in order to protect communities of colour
            - Interests of women of colour were marginalized in favour of the interests of the Black community as a whole

### Representational (In)equality and Privilege

- When people or groups are portrayed and presented according to the stereotypes ascribed to their communities/cultures
- Often, these stereotypes zero in on one aspect of identity and erase or ignore other aspects
- Example:
    - Early representations of feminism concerned with the exploitation and isolation of the “housewife” ==occluded the fact that women of colour and working class women== were not, on the whole, stay-at-home wives or mothers

### Beyond Gender and Race

- Crenshaw paved the way for how society and the law in America recognize that experiences of oppression or inequity cannot just be boiled down to race or gender
    - Began her work in 1989 when social understandings of identity were somewhat more simple that they are today
    - → Early writing only account directly for a narrow set of prejudices/inequities:
        - Race (black-white)
        - Gender (male-female)
- Today: Are many other social categories and identities that shape human experience
    - Being “of colour”
        - Not just being Black, but being or looking South Asian, Indigenous, Middle-Eastern, Asian, etc.
    - Being non-male
        - Not just being female, but also being trans, presenting or identifying as gender-neutral, etc.
    - Being on the spectrum
        - Forms of communicating or interacting with peers, family, teachers, co-workers may be considered “weird”
        - People may find themselves ignored, ridiculed, punished
    - Being dis-abled
        - Dis-ability of the body
            - e.g., Wheelchair users may find difficulties entering or navigating a building
        - Dis-ability of the senses
            - e.g., May be difficult or impossible to hear bus driver call your stop
            - To see where a set of stairs begins or where there is a crosswalk
        - Dis-ability of speech, language, vocality
            - e.g., Speech impairment: simply asking for directions may be impossible
            - Same goes for those who do not speak the dominant language of the society they are in
        - Intellectual dis-ability

### Privilege and Normality

- To go through life “unmarked” by race, sex, etc. likely means you will *benefit* — or have *privilege* — as a result of presenting in a **normative** way
- **Normative**
    - What is normative is not the same as what is *normal*
    - Not about odds or statistics
    - Is about what a society or culture takes for granted about how people should look, act, communicate, think, etc.
- An intersectional understanding of identity and power recognizes that ==multiple factors interact to shape experience== and therefore *privilege*
    - Include but not limited to: gender, race, ability, migrant status, language income, family status, heritage/history, ability, education, religion, etc.

> [!important]+ Someone can be marginalized by one form of discrimination, while experiencing privilege from another aspect of their presentation of identity
> - Privilege and oppression are not zero-sum equations

## Global Feminism: How Do Different Cultural Backgrounds Shape Local Expressions of Feminism?

### “White Women’s Feminism”: Feminism and Class

> [!important] Race, ethnicity, and religion shape how people understand the priority of feminist politics

- Criticism of white women’s feminism
    - Tied to class
    - Were talking about women’s rights, but not in an inclusive way
- Early feminism was largely concerned with issues faced by privileged white women
    - Global fight for women’s right to vote was first successful for only ==land-owning women==
        - Rich women
        - Poor women and women of colour remained disenfranchised
        - Shows how class and race intersected with gender rights
    - Next extended to women in majority White countries, etc.
    - Global fight for equal pay and representation in the workforce is overwhelmingly related to middle-class jobs
        - It is in roles that are taken up by both men and women where there is relatively equal pay
        - ! Low-paying or informal work is often held by people of colour
            - A (female) maid will still make less money than a (male) bricklayer
            - White women still make relatively more than women of colour where there is relative parity in pay between women and men

> [!obs]+ $\implies$ Feminism today is still defined and understood in different ways for different groups
> - Women in different groups will have accordingly different interests and concerns

### “White Women’s Feminism”: Feminism and Race

- Factors that put White women and “White feminism” at a relative advantage in North America
    - White women tend to stay in school longer
        - Often fewer demands to leave school to contribute to household from a young age
        - Often more family money to pay for higher educatoin
    - White women — if in a majority White country — are more likely to be fluent English speakers with better written English skills
- Historically, in the US, White family households have had fewer members
    - Fewer people to support → more money available to each member → more financial opportunity for females
        - Single-parent families (lower family total income) are statistically more often led by women of colour
        - More “free time” for White women to engage in activism
- $\implies$ White women have ended up being the major feminist scholars/theorists and activists in North America, but
    - This is changing!

### Chicana (Mexican-American) Feminism in the US

- Mexico was colonized by Spain in the 1800s
- Mid-1800s:
    - Mexican people organized Chicanx communities in the North
    - Focused on Mexican cultural history
    - Rejecting impositions of Spanish rule
- 1848:
    - US forcefully took these parts of Mexico
    - Now the population is concentrated in what is the American South-West and California
- 1960s: Chicana women began organizing
    - Following a series of general movements for Chicanx culture and liberation
- & Chicana women wanted to *maintain* concern with Chicanx cultural history, oppression, and injustice (faced by men, women, children)
    - Focusing on the fact that this history ==has affected Chicana *women*, specifically==, in particular ways
    - Main concern:
        - Importation of Catholicism from Spain brought archetypes of “virgin”
        - Placed ideal female figure in opposition to non-Catholic Indigenous Mexican women
        - → Who then became framed as sexually available and of “loose morals”
        - → Led to increased sexual assaults on Chicana women
        - & Addressing this legacy is a major concern of Chicana feminism

> [!important] Historical forces/oppressions shape the priorities of feminists in different cultures

### Representing Same-Sex Female Relationships in India

- Historically:
    - Feminist movements in India have had many internal disputes around how to represent lesbian relationships
    - Often prefer the term “women who love women”
- Major concern:
    - Term “lesbian” was too American
        - Assumed a type of *activist* identity/possibility
    - Many Indian feminists felt that the *activist identity* linked to the term *lesbian* was not necessarily a priority for many Indian women, who might
        - Prefer to prioritize aspects of ==religion or national unity== over sexual identity
- Over time, term *lesbian* has entered Indian public culture
    - Some groups of feminists still reject it

> [!important]+ There is not one single, universal language for feminism or equity
> - Different global cultures have different priorities for how they think and talk about feminist concerns
>     - e.g., Sexual orientation

### Saba Mahmood’s Discussion of Islamic Feminism

- 1990s: Anthropologist Saba Mahmood studies a small women’s mosque movement in Cairo, Egypt
- Western vs. Islamic feminism perspectives:
    - Western view of veiling:
        - Seen as a form of oppression
        - Falls under a deeply “patriarchal” system of power
    - Islamic women’s perspective (from Mahmood’s study):
        - Veiling can be a chosen form of expression
        - A conscientious form a feminism
        - Represents taking pride in their religious/social traditions
            - Can be empowering within their cultural context
            - Demonstrates agency in religious practice
        - Veiling as a source of serenity
        - Provides a deep and meaningful sense of belonging
        - *Not* a forced oppression or demand that they display religious virtue as defined by men

> [!important]+ Feminism does not always mean “resistance”
> - Feminism is not necessarily based on a rejection of rules or laws determined by people in positions of power or privilege
> - We must not be careful to label women who conform to gendered traditions as *victims* in need of *saving* by way of (Western) feminism

## Critical Race Theory for HCI

- **Critical Race Theory**
    - Theoretical framework originating in the 1970s in order to more *critically* (thoughtfully, analytically) engage racial disparities and inequality

> [!summary]+ Main points of **Critical Race Theory**
> - Racism is an ordinary, everyday practice
> - Race is socially constructed
> - New methods are needed to better represent experiences of racialized communities
>     - & Emphasis on value of *story-telling*
>         - ==Privileging the stories, histories, voices of people of colour==
>         - As opposed to using these histories to advantage a particular argument or line of analysis
>         - & Writing about marginalized peoples should always invoke ==working with marginalized peoples== to determine how their stories get told

### Hashtag Publics

- **Hashtag Publics**
    - Type of online community organization that uses hashtags, in order to
        - Draw attention to, and
        - Stake a claim in current social issues
- e.g., \#BlackLivesMatter

> [!important]+ Use of hashtags to draw attention to issues can be read as ==a type of race-critical HCI==
> - Is a mode of centreing the voices and concerns of community members themselves
>     - Within larger efforts to address social inequality

### Examples of Race-Equitable Designs

### Opportunities with Design

- & Giving voice through design
    - e.g., \#MeToo movement on Twitter
